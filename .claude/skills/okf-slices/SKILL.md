  OKF code-understanding slices — FIND the right slice before changing code, and MAINTAIN the slice set so it
  never goes stale. TRIGGER on either intent: (FIND) an agent — ESPECIALLY an optimizer/fixer node about to edit
  a subsystem — needs to know how a code vertical works or WHERE to change it ("how does <subsystem> work",
  "where do I change X", "which files own Y", before touching runner/sandbox/observe/optimize/etc.); or (MAINTAIN)
  someone asks when/how to update the slices, what a slice's blast scope is, whether a slice is stale, or runs the
  drift gate. Works on ANY repo that has `.agents/okf/` (config in `okf.config.json`); the cards live in
  `.agents/okf/topics/*.md`. Slices are OPTIMIZER-FACING reference, NEVER injected into a worker node's runtime
  prompt — this skill is how the out-of-band fixer reads them on demand.

# OKF slices — find the right one, keep them honest

A **slice** is a per-vertical *lifecycle* card: it traces one functionality along its spine (where it's DECLARED →
its TERMINAL effect) and points an agent at the exact files/lines that implement it, plus the invariants and known
drift. It is pointers + understanding, never a copy of the code. The cards live in `.agents/okf/topics/*.md`; the
design/rationale is `docs/research/memory/code-understanding-and-anti-drift.md` (§2 discovery · §4+§4.1 anti-drift &
blast ladder · §5 backlog) — cite it, don't restate it. This skill is the OPERATIONAL procedure for the two things
you actually do with slices.

**Why this exists:** a fixer that greps the whole repo to understand a subsystem wastes context and gets stale
facts; a slice gives it the validated map. But a slice is only useful if (a) you can FIND the right one and (b) it
is FRESH. This skill is both halves.

---

## MODE A — FIND the slice for a task (the reader)

Use when you are about to change, debug, or explain a code area and want the validated map instead of re-deriving
it from the repo. **Procedure (stop at the first step that resolves):**

1. **Normalize the query** to concrete keys: the target FILE path(s), SYMBOL name(s), and/or CONCEPT keywords.
2. **Match against the cards** in `.agents/okf/topics/` and RANK by *where* the match lands — ownership beats mention:
   - FILE → `grep -rl "<path>" .agents/okf/topics/` — a card listing it in `seeds:` or its **Anchors** OWNS it.
   - SYMBOL → `grep -rl "<symbol>" .agents/okf/topics/` — a card listing it in `symbols:`/`aliases:` or Anchors OWNS it.
   - CONCEPT → match `key`/`aliases`/`title`/`tags` in frontmatter. A bare prose/DRIFT-NOTE mention is a WEAK match —
     do not pick a card just because the word appears in its prose; prefer the card that declares it in frontmatter.
3. **If no card matches** (the file/symbol is uncovered): escalate to codegraph — `codegraph query <symbol>` /
   `codegraph explore <symbol>` / `codegraph callers <symbol>` — to find the owning module, then map module → the
   card whose `seeds:` live in that module. If STILL none, the vertical is **UNCOVERED**: say so plainly (it's a gap
   to author a card via MAINTAIN), and fall back to reading the code directly. NEVER invent a slice.
4. **Read the matched card**: the *"Why / how it works"* paragraph = the mental model; the **Anchors** (grouped by
   stage) = the exact `path:line` to edit; the **Freshness / DRIFT NOTE** = known gaps and branch caveats.
5. **VALIDATE before you trust it** (just-in-time; a stale slice is worse than none): run the gate for that one card —
   `cd .agents/okf/topics && node _generate.mjs --check <key>`. Read WHICH signal it returns — they mean DIFFERENT
   things, and only one affects whether you can trust the anchors:
   - `HEALTH: anchor …` / `seed missing` → an anchor's symbol/line moved or a file is gone — the anchors you'd return
     may be WRONG. Reconcile against the live file (or re-author per MAINTAIN) before relying on them; flag it.
   - `DRIFT: auto region is stale — run --write` → ONLY the machine-derived region (git arc / lessons cluster / blast
     section) is out of date — e.g. a new memory was added. The CURATED anchors are still VALID; you may trust them.
     `--write` to refresh is a MAINTAIN chore, it does NOT block FIND.
   - `ok` → fresh.
6. **Apply**: navigate by the anchors, respect the stated INVARIANT, and check the DRIFT NOTE for traps.

**FIND output shape** (what you return to whoever asked): the slice key(s); the *specific* anchors relevant to THIS
task (not the whole card); the INVARIANT you must not break; and a freshness verdict — `fresh` / `stale-flagged` /
`uncovered`. If `uncovered`, name the gap.

**FIND bar (must hold):** you cited a REAL card (or honestly reported `uncovered`); you returned the anchors that
matter for the task, not a card dump; you ran `--check` on the chosen card and reported its verdict; you did NOT
present a stale or invented slice as authoritative.

---

## MODE B — MAINTAIN the slice set

Use when adding/updating slices, after a merge, before a commit that touches anchored code, or when asked "is this
stale / what's the blast scope." **Three cadences (only the first is wired today):**

- **Pre-commit (blocking) — the gate.** `cd .agents/okf/topics && node _generate.mjs --check`. It emits TWO signal
  kinds, fix them differently: `HEALTH:` = a seed/anchor file or symbol/line moved → a REAL fix (reconcile the anchor);
  `DRIFT: auto region is stale` = only the machine-derived region is out of date → just `node _generate.mjs --write`.
  (DRIFT fires when the code OR the substrate it derives from changed — e.g. a new git commit or a new memory note —
  so expect it routinely; HEALTH should be rare and is the one that matters.) The anchor check resolves definition
  anchors as cited line ∈ the symbol's codegraph span, call-site/field anchors as symbol-present-in-file. Always
  `--write` then re-`--check` until clean before committing.
- **Post-merge (advisory).** Re-derive and review drift flags; re-author the CURATED half of any flagged card. **NEVER
  auto-rewrite curated prose** — the machine only refills the region between the `okf:auto` markers.
- **Rolling (discovery / add-retire).** Re-run the §2 procedure: roots → codegraph reachability (MEMBERSHIP) → cluster
  by module → rank by centrality → name by commit-scope → liveness by git RECENCY (not frequency). A cluster that
  LEFT the reachable set → retire (human-gated); a new reachable cluster + fresh scope → add a card; reachable-but-old
  → dormant-flag.

**Blast scope — the granularity ladder (`code-understanding-and-anti-drift.md §4.1`).** A slice's "blast" is not one
thing; it is a ladder matched to cadence:
| Rung | Fires when | Cadence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| file-existence | a seed/anchor file is gone | pre-commit | ✅ built |
| symbol + line∈span | anchor symbol moved/renamed, or a def-anchor's line left its span | pre-commit (blocking) | ✅ built |
| method-body AST hash | a tracked function's body changed (formatting-insensitive) | post-merge (advisory) | 🔬 designed (E4) |
| codegraph impact | a change's blast-radius reaches the slice's anchors via a dep outside its seeds | post-merge (advisory) | 🔬 designed (E5) |
Match granularity to cadence: coarse (filename) over a 27-file slice cries wolf every commit; fine (method-body) fires
only on real change. Today the gate is symbol-accurate, not yet paragraph-accurate (E4). Anchor on the SYMBOL, treat
the line as a hint (the planned E8 stable-symbol-id upgrade).

**To ADD a card:** create `.agents/okf/topics/<key>.md` with frontmatter (`key`, `title`, `description`, `seeds:`,
`symbols:`, `aliases:`, `tags:`) + a one-paragraph "Why / how it works" tracing the spine + stage-grouped **Anchors**
(`path:line — symbol — role`, every line OPENED and verified) + a Freshness/DRIFT NOTE. Then `--write` to fill the
auto region and `--check` to gate. Keep prose paths FULL (`packages/...`) so the gate doesn't false-positive on
relative fragments.

---

## Invariants (the laws — do not violate)
- **Optimizer-facing, never injected.** A slice is read by the out-of-band fixer/optimizer; it is NEVER put into a
  worker node's own runtime prompt (a node must not see its own failure history / code map). Keep slices out of any
  directory a worker node's tools sweep.
- **Pointers + semantics, never a copy.** A slice points at code and explains it; it does not duplicate it.
- **Validate after retrieval (JIT), don't front-load.** Pull the slice when needed and `--check` it before trusting;
  stale context is actively harmful.
- **Deterministic-first; never auto-rewrite curated prose.** The gate is deterministic; an advisory/LLM signal is a
  hint to a human/agent glance, never an auto-edit of the understanding.
- **Anchors are the contract.** The `path:line — symbol` anchors (+ seeds) are what the gate validates and what FIND
  returns; prose is commentary.

## Self-check before returning
- FIND: Did I cite a real card (or say `uncovered`), return task-relevant anchors (not a dump), run `--check`, and
  report freshness? Did I avoid presenting a stale/invented slice as truth?
- MAINTAIN: Did I run `--check` (and `--write` if curated content changed)? Did I leave curated prose hand-authored
  (no auto-rewrite)? For add/retire, did I use codegraph reachability + git recency, not a guess?

## Pointers
- Design + rationale: `docs/research/memory/code-understanding-and-anti-drift.md` (§2 discovery · §4.1 blast ladder · §5 backlog E0–E8).
- External SOTA verification: `docs/research/memory/sota-verification-2026-06-30.md`.
- The generator: `.agents/okf/topics/_generate.mjs` (`--write` / `--check [key]`); config: `.agents/okf/okf.config.json`.
- Promotion path (Stage 2): port FIND/CHECK into a deterministic `piflowctl okf find|check|build` verb, gate on the
  E6 retrieval eval, then add this skill to the `piflowctl skills install` bundle.
