# Blueprints — the graph-level scaffolding contract

A **blueprint** is the GRAPH-level sibling of an agent-type preset. A preset seeds one **node** (a tool bundle
+ a role-prompt); a blueprint seeds a **shape** — a parametric topology + a wiring rule for a whole sub-DAG. It
is the recurring skeleton ("fan-out research → fuse → author") an init agent stamps when the task fits the
shape, so the DAG isn't reinvented each time.

**The grammar these recipes obey — the slot model, the three compose ops (stamp whole · insert a fragment
anywhere · hand-add a node), and the file-transfer/token rules — is `AUTHORING-GUIDE.md`. Read it first; this
README is the catalog + the pick-a-blueprint contract.**

A blueprint is **NOT loadable and NOT a template.** Its lane COUNT and lane CONTENT are HOLES the init agent
fills by reasoning about the target task — it is instructions for an author, not a `node.json`. It rides the
EXISTING scaffolder (`piflowctl new` / `add-node` + Write); it needs ZERO engine/core code.

| | seeds | loadable? | filled by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **template** | a concrete DAG | yes (`loadTemplate`) | already complete |
| **blueprint** | a parametric SHAPE | **no** (holes) | the init agent, at author time |
| **agent preset** | one node's tools+role | no | `mergePreset` at author time |
| **profile** | — | (run-time pruning of a built DAG) | the runner, at RUN time |

Blueprint ⟂ profile: a blueprint GENERATES nodes at author time; a profile PRUNES an already-built DAG at run
time. Different layers; never confuse them.

## Where blueprints live (boundary-clean, mirrors agent-presets)

- **Catalog (the one home):** `~/.piflow/blueprints/<id>.md` — global, user-extensible.
- **Seeds (bundled with this skill):** `references/blueprints/<id>.md`. On init, **materialize any missing seed
  into `~/.piflow/blueprints/` (create-if-absent only — NEVER overwrite a user-edited blueprint).**
- A user authors a new blueprint by dropping a `<id>.md` into `~/.piflow/blueprints/`; available immediately.
  Nothing blueprint-specific goes into `packages/*` or the GUI. The taxonomy is open, not fixed.

## The contract — when the init agent picks a blueprint

1. **Read** `~/.piflow/blueprints/<id>.md`. If absent: HALT — never invent a blueprint shape.
2. **Decide the parameters by REASONING about the target task** — above all the lane count N (the blueprint
   states its own heuristic; e.g. one research lane per distinct capability/unknown the workflow needs).
3. **Stamp the shape via the scaffolder:** `piflowctl new <dir>`, then one `piflowctl add-node` per node with
   the flags the blueprint's wiring rule prescribes (`--dep` for edges, disjoint `--owns` per parallel lane,
   `--artifact`, `--read`, `--on-fail block` on every PRODUCING node).
4. **Bind each lane to a base agent with `--agent-type <id>`** — one flag folds the preset's tools + skill +
   the `agentType` branding label (via the real `mergePreset`). The preset's role-prompt is inherited BY
   REFERENCE at render, so you do NOT prepend the role body. Add any extra tools with `--tool`; override the
   skill with `--skill`. (Unknown `<id>` ⇒ HALT; never invent a preset.)
5. **Write each node's `prompt.md`** with the Write tool — ONLY the lane's task (the role comes from the preset
   at render). The scaffolder never writes prose; a node with no `prompt.md` FAILS `checkRefs` as a dangling ref.
6. **`piflowctl extract <dir>` must EXIT 0** with the shape the blueprint implies (the loader-backed oracle, no
   model). Not green ⇒ fix the cause (missing prompt.md · dangling dep · non-disjoint parallel `owns`); never
   ship a red extract.

## Idempotence

Stamp **once, from the author's original intent + chosen N** — never re-stamp over an already-bound `prompt.md`
(the role body would double-prepend). On a re-init, start from the same task intent, not the previous output.

## Authoring a new blueprint (the format)

A single agent-facing `.md` to the bar of the `agentic-prompt-design` skill. It MUST state: the **topology**
(the node shape + which parts are parametric); the **parametricity rule** (the heuristic for each hole — give a
countable range, not "some"); the **lane→base-agent map** (which of the six base agents each role binds to, via
the by-hand binding above); the **per-node I/O contract** (read-this → write-that, and the output SHAPE — prose
for an LLM reader, strict only at a machine boundary); the **wiring discipline** (the exact deps + disjoint-owns
rule that makes the stages come out right); and a **pointer to a golden worked instance**. Keep it terse and
single-purpose (≤ ~90 lines), like this file.

## The blueprints that exist

- **`research-synthesize-author`** — fan-out of N parallel research lanes → one synthesize node → one author
  node. Golden: `.piflow/outbound-design/template/` (the cold-email outbound playbook designer).
- **`produce-verify-fix`** — a self-correcting pipeline: `plan → produce → verify ⟲(reroute→produce, max K)`,
  optionally ×N per item. Golden: `.piflow/example-produce-verify-fix/template/`.
- **`fan-out-map-reduce`** — N independent workers (disjoint owns) → one reduce/consensus node. Golden:
  `templates/quality/verify/`.
- **`spec-fanout-build`** — `design(freeze one spec) → [producer×M writing disjoint fragments] → verify-join →
  build`. Golden: `.piflow/example-spec-fanout/template/`.
- **`candidate-fusion-refine`** — `plan → draft(moa panel→judge) → harden(best-of-n→select) → publish`, via the
  built-in `--fusion` topology. Golden: `.piflow/example-fusion/template/`.
