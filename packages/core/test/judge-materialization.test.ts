// Judge-gate DAG MATERIALIZATION at load time (expert-representations · "Judge expansion").
//
// THE GAP this oracle closes: a `judgeGate` authored on a producer node was lowered to a `judgeNode`
// shape by `compileNodeBase`/`lowerGates` but NOTHING inserted it into the compiled WorkflowSpec — so a
// judge gate ran no judge. These tests assert through the PUBLIC `loadTemplate` seam that a producer
// carrying a `judgeGate` materializes a REAL judge NodeIntent wired into the DAG:
//
//   • id `<producer>__judge`, agentType:'judge', tier == judgeTier (and != the producer's tier);
//   • prompt CONTAINS the rubric (the materialized judge prompt);
//   • io.reads = the producer's produced artifact(s); deps place the judge AFTER the producer;
//   • a producer-side `rerouteTo`→producer action carries the retry budget (the judge-fail loop);
//   • the producer's downstream CONSUMERS depend on the judge (the judge gates the hand-off);
//   • the judge model MUST differ from the producer (the design invariant — a same-tier judge is REJECTED).
//
// Additivity guard: a template with NO judge gate compiles byte-identically (no `__judge` node appears).
// A minimal change that only emits the producer reroute op WITHOUT inserting a real judge node FAILS here.
