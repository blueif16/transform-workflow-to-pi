// WorktreeSandbox / WorktreeSandboxProvider — per-run git WRITE isolation, LIVE.
//
// A faithful port of templates/pi-runner/run.mjs `setupWorktree`/`finishWorktree`
// (run.mjs 400–460) onto the @piflow/core RunScope/openRun seam (types.ts). Each
// RUN gets a fresh git worktree on a NEW branch `pi/<run>` checked out at HEAD, in
// a sibling `<repoRoot>/../.pi-worktrees/<run>` OUTSIDE the repo. Every node of the
// run runs INSIDE that one worktree, so N concurrent runs are PHYSICALLY write-
// isolated — a node in one run cannot see or clobber another run's files, and none
// of them touch the main checkout's working tree. After the last node the worktree
// is committed to its branch (work is durable for a human-gated merge) and the
// checkout is removed (the branch persists).
//
// PLAN — openRun/create/dispose mapped to run.mjs, with the deliberate divergences:
//   openRun({ run, repoRoot, outDir })  ← port of setupWorktree (run.mjs 400–433)
//     1. wtPath = <dirname(repoRoot)>/.pi-worktrees/<run>     (run.mjs 401: sibling, OUTSIDE the repo)
//     2. idempotent: `git worktree remove --force <wtPath>` + rm -rf the dir       (run.mjs 404–405)
//     3. `git -C <repoRoot> worktree add -B pi/<run> <wtPath> HEAD`                (run.mjs 408; -B resets to HEAD)
//     4. for every TRACKED package (git ls-files package.json) whose base node_modules exists,
//        symlink it into the worktree at the same rel path                          (run.mjs 409–431)
//     → return a WorktreeRunScope whose `root` is wtPath.
//   create(opts)  ← the per-node VIEW (no run.mjs analogue — run.mjs reuses ONE driver inside the wt)
//     workdir = <wtPath>/<opts.workdir> INSIDE the shared worktree, so every node's WRITES land in the
//     worktree, never the main checkout. file/exec/readFile/downloadDir/putFiles mechanics are copied
//     VERBATIM from InMemorySandbox (real `spawn`, detached process-group kill + closed stdin +
//     ExecOpts.signal SIGTERM→SIGKILL; downloadDir via fs.cp). Per-node dispose is a NO-OP w.r.t. the
//     shared worktree (mirrors daytona `ownsVm:false`) — the scope owns the worktree's lifetime.
//   dispose()  ← port of finishWorktree (run.mjs 438–459)
//     1. `git -C <wtPath> add -A` + `commit -m "pi(<run>): run artifacts"`          (run.mjs 441–442; empty commit is fine)
//     2. `git -C <repoRoot> worktree remove --force <wtPath>` (branch pi/<run> PERSISTS) (run.mjs 455)
//     DIVERGENCE from finishWorktree: run.mjs ALSO copied out/<run> back to the main tree (run.mjs
//     444–453) because its nodes wrote straight into the worktree's out/ and out/ is gitignored (so it
//     would vanish with the worktree). OUR runner already does `sandbox.downloadDir(node output, outDir)`
//     per node (runner.ts runNode 320–324), landing every node's deliverable on the host outDir (the
//     MAIN tree) BEFORE dispose — so we do NOT re-copy. The commit is what makes the run's worktree
//     contents durable on the branch; the host outDir already holds the collected deliverable.
//
//   Non-scoped create(opts) fallback: REJECTS. A worktree is inherently RUN-level (one branch + one
//   checkout span ALL of a run's nodes), so there is no shared worktree to put a node in without a run.
//   We reject with a clear pointer to openRun rather than spin up a throwaway one-node worktree (which
//   would be neither durable nor isolated in any useful way). The runner only ever calls openRun for a
//   provider that has it, so this path is the explicit "used wrong" guard.
