// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// LocalSandbox / LocalSandboxProvider — the IN-PLACE sandbox (a first-class
// `'local'` kind), the semantic OPPOSITE of InMemorySandbox.
//
// Every OTHER provider (InMemory, Seatbelt) `mkdtemp`s a THROWAWAY workspace and
// `downloadDir`-copies outputs back, then wipes it on dispose. This provider runs a
// node IN-PLACE in a REAL existing directory (the user's working tree): the sandbox
// root IS `resolve(opts.workdir)` (NO temp dir), `downloadDir` is a GUARDED IDENTITY
// (a no-op when remote==local, a THROW on a real mismatch), and `dispose` NEVER
// deletes the tree. It is the SDK port of the live `pi-runner/run.mjs` RUN_CWD model.
//
// It is InMemorySandbox (src/sandbox/index.ts) with FOUR in-place deltas only:
//   create   — root = resolve(workdir) (mkdir -p), NOT mkdtemp        (the GAP-1 guard)
//   write    — resolve under the real root (unchanged from InMemory)
//   download — guarded-identity: no-op iff realpath(remote)===realpath(local), else THROW
//   dispose  — NO-OP (the workspace is the user's project tree — NEVER fs.rm the root)
// exec keeps the reference impl's detached process-group kill + closed-stdin, but is
// SECURE BY DEFAULT: on darwin it wraps the command in the SHARED `seatbeltExecPlan`
// (sandbox-exec, kernel-enforced read+write scope) so a node reads ONLY its declared
// readScope + toolchain AND writes ONLY its workdir + declared writeScope (owns) + toolchain
// scratch — the whole reason a per-node swarm exists. A write to a sibling node dir, ~/.ssh,
// or the repo at large EPERMs. Network stays open (the `pi` agent MUST reach its model gateway
// — UNLIKE Codex, which sandboxes shell sub-commands that need no network).
// Off darwin the wrap is a no-op (warns once) until the Linux bwrap backend lands. The jail
// is the DEFAULT; `enforceReadScope:false` is the loud `danger-full-access` escape hatch.
// E10 EXEC-SCOPE (additive, opt-in): `execCwd`/`execReads` let a node whose BUILD runs from a
// PROJECT ROOT outside the run dir (e.g. `npm run …` in {{WORKSPACE}}/foo, importing a sibling
// kit) run FROM that root — the exec cwd becomes execCwd, both execCwd + execReads are granted
// read, and execCwd gets a getcwd `(literal)` so the build child's `uv_cwd` succeeds. Omitted ⇒
// cwd = the run-dir workdir (byte-identical to before). NOTE this is NOT the old collision-
// avoidance execCwd (dropped once U1 staged nodes under `_pi/<id>/`); it is a DIFFERENT, declared
// scope grant for out-of-tree builds — the Codex `writable_roots`/`--add-dir` idea on the read axis.
//
// Run-level isolation: `openRun` returns a TRIVIAL RunScope rooted at `repoRoot`
// whose `create` forwards to `provider.create` and whose `dispose` is a no-op — there
// is no shared backing resource to tear down (the filesystem IS the resource). This
// makes the in-place model the provider's EXPLICIT, documented behavior rather than
// relying on the runner's synthesized fallback.
