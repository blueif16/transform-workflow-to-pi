// It builds a MINIMAL NodeSpec the codec reads (only the fields `markersFromNode` touches) and emits the

// `{{WORKSPACE}}`/`{{state.*}}` tokens are carried THROUGH verbatim — the token resolution is the caller's
// concern (the loader leaves them for the runtime resolver; init-RUN resolves RUN/WORKSPACE intrinsically).
