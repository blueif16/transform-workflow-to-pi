 *    with size > 0; a DIR dest is "filled" when EVERY top-level entry of the SOURCE already exists under it
 *    (a per-SOURCE test, so a base-into-a-populated-root still stages while a genuine re-stage skips);
 *  - a DIR source copies RECURSIVELY (overlay merges over base, second wins); a FILE source copies as a file;
