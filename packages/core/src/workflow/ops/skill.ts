// SKILL stage resolver — the PRE-stage family sibling of `seed.ts`. A node's `skill` (a {{WORKSPACE}}-rooted
// path to an Agent-Skill directory) is, like a seed, a forced read-only artifact the runner stages into the
// sandbox BEFORE the model runs — here into the pi-native `.pi/skills/<name>/` discovery dir, then named with
// `pi --skill` (docs/design/skills-integration.md, option C). This module is the PURE resolution half: it
// turns the `skill` ref into the absolute host source + the staged dir name. The host→sandbox staging itself
// is the runner's job (it reuses `stageHostPathIntoSandbox`, the same seam seeds use).
//
// REUSE: token resolution is the shared `resolveTokens` (the SAME one seeds/artifacts use), so a skill ref
// resolves `{{WORKSPACE}}`/`{{RUN}}`/`{{state.*}}` exactly as every other path does — no bespoke parser. The
// staged dir `name` is the source's basename; pi reads the skill's REAL name from its `SKILL.md` frontmatter,
// so the container dir name is just a stable, collision-free location (no frontmatter parsing needed here).
//
// SA-A (feat/expert-representations) — this module also RE-EXPORTS the skill capability-manifest surface
// (skill-manifest.ts): `SkillManifest`, `parseSkillManifest`, `resolveSkillLoadout`, `preflightSkills`.
// The manifest surface is ADDITIVE: the existing `resolveSkillStage` staging path is unchanged, and a skill
// with no `requires`/`allowed` frontmatter is fully permissive (empty manifest = the prior behavior).
