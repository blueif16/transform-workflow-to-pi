// optimize/triage.ts — the four-way credit-assignment projector (v1.5 §3, §7). Turns the SCORE pass'
// NodeScore[] + the run digest into the worklist a fixer consumes (= the automated HERMES-ROUTING.md). It
// assigns each defect to ONE of four buckets — {LAPSE, SKILL, FUNCTIONALITY, ARCH} — ordered by ascending
// blast radius, deciding from OBSERVABLE signals only and defaulting toward the lowest blast radius (LAPSE)
// when unsure (the corpus-protection rule). Buckets it cannot yet decide NAME the missing signal in
// `needsSignal` rather than mis-attributing.
//
// What the MVP can decide deterministically (and what it defers):
//   • ARCH          ← a cross-node failure chain: the failure ORIGINATED upstream (digest.rootCauses, shipped).
//   • FUNCTIONALITY ← a clean-completing node whose Tier-1 OUTCOME failed = the product code is wrong. For
//                     game-omni the verify-milestone report IS the "product-test-as-node-outcome" v1.5 §7
//                     said FUNCTIONALITY needs — so it is decidable now, NOT defaulted to LAPSE.
//   • LAPSE         ← a self-originating structural failure with no code signal: the default-when-unsure.
//   • SKILL         ← needs cross-run recurrence (the first reader of Leg-A memory.md) — DEFERRED; until that
//                     signal exists, a residual is LAPSE + a `needsSignal` pointing at recurrence/prose-judge.
//
// The projector writes NOTHING and invents NO prose — the deep free-text root-cause trace the human used to
// hand-write is the FIXER's job. This emits pointers (failing check ids, the upstream chain), never a story.
