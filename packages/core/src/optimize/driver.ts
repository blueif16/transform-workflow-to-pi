// optimize/driver.ts — the FIX→GATE overlord (v1.5 §6). A DETERMINISTIC, straight-line driver: it COMPOSES
// the bounded model stages (the context-isolated fixer; the held-out replay scorer) but the control flow,
// the gate decision, the caps, and the land policy are all CODE. "The model PROPOSES + SCORES; deterministic
// code DECIDES, BOUNDS, and LANDS — and the loop NEVER mutates the live file" (SkillOpt cycle.py:90).
//
// The fixer writes to a candidate COPY ref (prepareCandidate), the scorer reads the copy, the gate compares
// candidate vs base on the held-out VAL slice, and the driver RECORDS a decision (adopted | staged |
// discarded). The PHYSICAL landing (stage to a dir / adopt = backup-then-overwrite the live file) is land.ts,
// driven from this manifest — so this module touches no live file. Bounds: a per-round edit_budget (the
// "learning rate" — caps the expensive fixer attempts), a cumulative token budget, and the rejected-edit
// buffer (never re-propose a dead edit). Single-candidate; multi-candidate Pareto is v1.5 §6 phase-2.
