//
// A LIBRARY consumer passes a PLAIN resolved-config OBJECT; core compiles the WorkflowSpec and runs it via
// the existing `runWorkflow`. There is NO env parsing here — that is `loadConfig`'s job (the CLI/convention
// layer). The WORKFLOW BRIDGE stays CONSUMER-INJECTED: the consumer supplies either a literal `workflowSpec`
// or a `buildWorkflowSpec` factory (the workflow-dialect-specific bit core does NOT own). `runFromConfig` is
// the clean seam the `piflow run` CLI subcommand (the follow-on unit) calls after it resolves the env.
