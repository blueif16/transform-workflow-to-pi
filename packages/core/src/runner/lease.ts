// P6 — the single-writer run.lock lease. A mid-run migration hands ONE run between two runner
// processes (laptop ⇄ cloud VM). The journal writer already serializes PARALLEL LANES within one
// process (journal.ts writeChains), but nothing stops TWO RUNNER PROCESSES from both writing
// `.pi/journal.json` if the frozen source runner and the resumed target runner overlap. This lease is
// that guard: a runner acquires it at start, heartbeats it between stages, and releases it on
// freeze/exit; a second runner refuses to start while a LIVE lease is held, and STEALS a lease only
// when the prior holder is provably gone (stale heartbeat OR dead pid). Windmill's `SKIP LOCKED` and
// Restate's single-processor lease are the prior art; the migration orchestrator relies on this so the
// two runners are never live at once.
//
// The lock is `${run}/.pi/run.lock`. Ownership is `(pid, host, acquiredAt)` — a stolen lease gets a new
// `acquiredAt`, so the prior holder's `renew`/`release` become no-ops (it can no longer clobber the
// new owner). Cross-host liveness can't be probed, so a foreign-host holder is only ever reclaimed via
// the ttl (heartbeat age); same-host holders also check the real pid.
