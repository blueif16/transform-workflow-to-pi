// MCP config staging (env/secret porting — see docs/research/tool-bridge-env-2026-06-21.md) — the
// per-node env-allowlist additions (the secret-broker seam). Extracted verbatim from runner.ts (the
// §2.1 cluster E split); re-exported there so the barrel and the internal-importing tests
// (runner.test.ts → selectedBridgedTool, cloud-provider-cred.test.ts → cloudCredEnvAdditions) keep
// resolving these from runner.ts.
//
// When a node selected bridge tools (mcp./oc.) AND a run-level `mcpConfig` is present, the runner stages
// the server map to `_pi/mcp.json` (verbatim — the map carries `$VAR` refs, NEVER literal secrets) and
// injects, via the `CreateOpts.env` seam, `PIFLOW_MCP_CONFIG` (the ABSOLUTE in-sandbox path of that file)
// + the referenced secret env vars. The bridge inside the pi child expands the refs at resolution time.
// An `oc.*` selection stages identically: the host supplies the reserved `openclaw` server in
// `mcpConfig.servers` exactly like any MCP server, and the runner writes/forwards it verbatim.

 * Build the env additions for a node that staged `_pi/mcp.json`: `PIFLOW_MCP_CONFIG` (the absolute path)

 * only the `$VAR` names the config actually references cross into the node; the host env is NEVER spread
 * wholesale.
 *
 * The resolver is the broker seam. By default it reads `process.env` (today's behavior), but a host can
 * plug a scoped-token / sealing broker: it MINTS a SHORT-LIVED, SCOPED token HOST-SIDE and returns THAT
 * here, so the runner injects the scoped token as the env value and the bridge expands `$VAR` to it
 * exactly as today — the real long-lived credential NEVER crosses into the cloud VM. (A sealing/egress
 * proxy that swaps the scoped reference for the real credential at the gateway is the alternative the
 * same seam supports.) The resolver gets `{ nodeId, isCloud }` so it can mint a per-node, cloud-only token.
 *
 * The allowlist is enforced identically for every backend, but it is LOAD-BEARING on cloud: a cloud VM
 * (daytona/e2b) does NOT inherit `process.env` (the provider's exec merges only `{...this.env,...opts.env}`),
 * so these additions are the ONLY way a secret reaches the VM — and they must be exactly the referenced
 * set, nothing else, so an unrelated host secret can't ride along. On local backends the child already
 * inherits `process.env` via the provider's exec merge; forwarding the referenced (resolved) set here is
 * harmless (and correct if a var lives only in the parent process), and we still never blast the rest.
