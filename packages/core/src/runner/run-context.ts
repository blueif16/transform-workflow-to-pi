// The shared mutable run state (`RunContext`) + the host↔sandbox staging helpers — extracted verbatim
// from runner.ts (the §2.1 cluster F split). This is THE PIVOT module: the lane / retry / lifecycle
// modules import `RunContext` (a type) and `readHostFile`/`stageHostPathIntoSandbox` (values) FROM HERE,
// a LEAF, so they never have to import back into runner.ts — which would be a circular edge (RISK 1).
// `RunContext` and these helpers are internal seams (not on the barrel), re-exported from runner.ts only
// for symmetry with the rest of the split.
