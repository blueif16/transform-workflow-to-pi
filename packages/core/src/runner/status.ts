// SERIALIZED + ATOMIC writer. The status file is the SINGLE source of truth a watcher polls (see the
// header), AND it is written from PARALLEL lanes (runWorkflow's per-stage Promise.all) plus the run
// loop — concurrent writers. Two hazards the naive `await fs.writeFile` has:
//   1. INTERLEAVING — two overlapping async writes to the SAME path are not ordered, so a later
//      `writeStatus` can land on disk BEFORE an earlier one's bytes finish, leaving a stale record
//      (run.mjs avoided this for free: it is single-threaded + synchronous `writeFileSync`).
//   2. TORN READS — `fs.writeFile` is not atomic; a concurrent reader (the viz/dashboard) can observe
//      a half-written, unparseable file (reproduced empirically: ~3/472 reads torn under load).
// Fix: a per-directory promise chain serializes writes (so they never overlap → last-write-wins is
// real), and each write goes to a unique temp file then `rename`s into place (atomic on POSIX/NTFS),
// so a reader sees only a complete prior or complete next file — never a partial one.
