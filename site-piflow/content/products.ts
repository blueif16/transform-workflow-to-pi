/* ============================================================
   products.ts — THE single source of truth for the product
   screens (Agents · Workflow · Memory). One file, one shape, so
   the same entry powers BOTH the grid card face (keyword eyebrow
   + title) AND the full-screen detail view you reach by clicking
   into a card (`details`). Update copy here only.

   Card face shows: `keywords` (short eyebrow) + `title`.
   Detail view shows: `summary` + `details.lead` + `details.points`.
   Presentation (HUD silhouette, grid layout, imagery) lives in
   the component — this file stays purely informational.
