summary: "Follow a live run with the GUI, the TUI, or the watch sentinel — all monitor-only twins of one stream."

> failure signatures from `reference/observability.md`.

All three surfaces read the same [observe stream](/docs/concepts/observe): the GUI, the TUI, and the
`watch` sentinel. They show which nodes are live, their context/cost, the warnings, and the shape of
the DAG — and they never diverge, because there is exactly one reader.
