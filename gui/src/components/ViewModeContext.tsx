/**
 * ViewModeContext — shares the active "view mode" between the bottom-left ModeBar
 * (which sets it, by click or keyboard) and every WorkflowNode (which paints a
 * mode-specific strip beneath itself). Threaded via context, not React Flow node
 * `data`, so toggling a mode re-renders the nodes without rebuilding the graph
 * (same pattern as ExpandContext).
 *
 * One mode is active at a time, or none. The per-node info each mode reveals is
 * map-level decoration only — the expanded HUD already shows the same fields, so
 * we don't duplicate it there.
