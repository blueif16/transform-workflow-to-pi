# Agent-marketplace layering — external validation (2025–2026)

> 2026-06-27 · research (Exa sweep, sub-agent) validating the **worker-type** design in
> `docs/design/expert-representations-worker-types.md` against the most-adopted platforms.
> Mandate was to *challenge* our loadout/posture model, not just confirm it.

## Dominant pattern

The 2025–2026 industry standard is a **two-layer architecture that separates tool connectivity
from procedural knowledge, and transacts them as distinct sub-agent units.** The marketplace unit
is *not* the full agent persona — it's the atom below it: a **skill** (procedural knowledge), an
**MCP server** (tool connectivity), or Salesforce's **topic+action** (the same idea in their
vocabulary). Full agent templates exist but are treated as *convenience bundles*, not the
compositional primitive. Composition is additive (combine capability components + choose execution
config separately). Naming converges on **task / job-to-be-done**, not human job titles (CrewAI is
the lone holdout). Verification is trending to a **tiered stack** — deterministic/execution tests →
LLM-as-judge → human spot-check — which maps almost directly onto our executor / designer / producer.

## Per-platform

| Platform | Market unit | Capability ⟂ posture? | Skill→tool coupling | Naming | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Anthropic Agent Skills** | Skill (SKILL.md) + MCP server | **YES** — skills (knowledge) / MCP (connectivity) / model+sandbox (runtime) are 3 layers | **YES** — `allowed-tools` in SKILL.md frontmatter | task ("pdf-processing", "competitive-analysis") | anthropic.com/news/skills |
| **OpenAI Apps / GPT Store** | App (MCP) + GPT (persona) | PARTIAL — Apps split connectivity, but model+prompt fused | NO | task-flavored (legacy GPTs role-named) | openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt |
| **CrewAI** | Agent (role+goal+backstory+tools) | **NO** — all fused in one Agent | partial (agent-led) | **role/job-title** ("Senior Data Researcher") | docs.crewai.com/en/concepts/agents |
| **Salesforce Agentforce / AgentExchange** | Action · Topic · Prompt-Template · Agent-Template | YES — topics (capability) vs reasoning+guardrails (posture) | partial (topic-led) | job-to-be-done ("Order Management") | salesforce.com/news/.../agentexchange |
| **Microsoft Copilot / Agent Store** | Agent (whole persona) | PARTIAL — builder separates knowledge/instructions/actions; store sells the fused agent | NO | task/domain ("IT Support Agent") | learn.microsoft.com/.../copilot-agent-store |
| **LangChain / LangGraph** | Tool + template; Assistant = graph + config | **YES** — Assistants separate graph logic from config (model+tools+prompt); middleware = posture | YES (config-led `selected_tools`) | task-oriented templates | github.com/jameskanyiri/langgraph_assistants |
| **MCP registries (Smithery / PulseMCP / official)** | **MCP server** (named tool bundle) | N/A (discovery only) | N/A | task/domain nouns | modelcontextprotocol.org/registry/about |
| **Relevance AI** | Agent (clone; prompt+tools) | PARTIAL — tools are shared canvas nodes; prompt per-agent | NO | task-purpose ("research-agent") | relevanceai.com/docs/build/agents/create-an-agent |

## Verdict on our design

- **Loadout ⟂ posture split — STRONGLY SUPPORTED.** Anthropic (skills+MCP vs runtime), Salesforce
  (topics vs reasoning+trust), LangGraph (graph vs config) all adopt it. Only CrewAI fuses, by
  choice (simplicity over composability). *Adjustment:* the posture's capability-gating needs
  **two levels** — *availability* (what the model sees) vs *permission* (what runs without
  approval) — finer than a single `sandbox` field (cf. Anthropic `allowedTools`/`disallowedTools`,
  wildcard `mcp__server__*`).
- **Skill-led composition — SUPPORTED.** The single most important data point: Anthropic's SKILL.md
  YAML carries **`allowed-tools`** (e.g. `Bash(python:*) Bash(npm:*) WebFetch`) — skills DO declare
  their tool surface, and picking a skill implicitly determines the MCP servers it coordinates.
  This is a *published open standard*, so building skill-led is ahead of most platforms but on the
  named trajectory. *Adjustment:* put `allowed-tools` **on the skill object itself** (portable,
  self-documenting), not only on the worker/loadout.
- **Three postures (executor/designer/producer) — SUPPORTED.** Maps to the 3-tier verification
  stack. *Gap:* **no platform ships "designer" (LLM-judge + retry) as a named posture** — it's
  hand-assembled. So our designer is architecturally novel and must be **fully specified**: judge
  model (a posture-level field, separate from the generation model), rubric/criteria source, retry
  budget, pass/fail threshold, escalation. Salesforce adds a useful axis we lacked: an **approval
  mode** (auto-run / approval-required / agent-decides) layered on top of capability.
- **Task-not-job naming — SUPPORTED.** Majority convention; CrewAI the deliberate exception (role
  framing as a *prompt-engineering* lever for LLM reasoning, not a marketplace name). No change to
  our rule; keep role/backstory as an internal prompt concern, never the worker's external name.

## Implications folded into the design

1. The skill→tool manifest is **TWO dual fields**: `allowed` (ceiling, the `allowed-tools`
   convention — what a running agent may use) and `requires` (floor — what must be bound; drives
   auto-wiring + preflight). See the follow-up sweep below.
2. Posture gains a **two-level capability gate** (availability vs permission) + an **autonomy/approval
   axis** — both of which piflow already has primitives for (`checkpoint`/G5, `rerouteGate`/G12).
3. The **designer posture needs a first-class spec** (judge-model field + rubric + retry budget +
   threshold) because we're inventing a named abstraction the market only assembles ad hoc.

## Required tools — the dependency FLOOR (follow-up sweep)

Follow-up: `allowed-tools` is a *ceiling* (what an agent MAY use); does anyone declare a *floor*
(what a skill REQUIRES to run)? Finding: a machine-readable `requires` floor is **novel for agent
platforms but standard in plugin ecosystems.**

| Ecosystem | Floor? | Field | Drives |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code `plugin.json` | Y — plugin↔plugin only | `dependencies` | install-time presence of other plugins (NOT tools/MCP) |
| Claude Code `SKILL.md` / agents | N — ceiling only | `allowed-tools`/`disallowedTools` | allowlist/denylist; no mandatory-tool floor |
| MCP `server.json` | Partial — env only | `environmentVariables[].isRequired` | start-time env floor for one server |
| Semantic Kernel | Y — API deps | `apiDependencies` | required HTTP APIs + auth (closest agent analog) |
| LangGraph `langgraph.json` | Y — packages | `dependencies` | deploy-time package install (not tool bindings) |
| Agent Packaging Standard v0.1 | Y — nascent | `dependencies.models[].required` | provisioning + preflight (community draft) |
| CrewAI / AutoGen / GPT Actions / Agentforce | N | — | runtime assignment / auth only; no floor |
| **npm / VS Code / RPM-Debian** | **Y — mature** | `dependencies` · `extensionDependencies` · `Requires:` | **install-time hard block = our preflight** |

Verdict: NOVEL-FOR-AGENTS, STANDARD-IN-PLUGINS. No agent platform has "this skill requires MCP
server X or it can't run" driving both auto-wire + preflight. Closest: VS Code `extensionDependencies`
(install block) + Semantic Kernel `apiDependencies`. **Adopt the name `requires`** (RPM `Requires:`,
APS `required:true`, package.json) listing tool/MCP/capability ids matched against the live capability
registry at node-init — NOT `dependencies` (reads as install-time packages).
