# SDK canonical build plan — promote the consumer glue INTO `@piflow/core`

## Load-bearing canonical decisions (the "best version", with rationale)

- **D1 — OPEN-1 is a RUNNER bug, fix it at the root.** The runner stages three FIXED files —
  `_pi/prompt.md` (`runner.ts:444`), `_pi/tools.ts` (`:451`), `_pi/mcp.json` (`:399/459`) — so parallel
  nodes that share a workspace (the in-place case) clobber each other. game-omni worked around it THREE
  times (the `execCwd` decoupling, the absolute `@promptFile`, the `wf.nodes` `sandbox.workspace` mutation).
  **Fix:** namespace the staged files per node — `_pi/<id>/{prompt.md,tools.ts,mcp.json}` — so EVERY
  provider is collision-safe and the three hacks dissolve. Unconditional (strictly safer; InMemory just
  gains a dir level).
- **D2 — in-place sandbox = a first-class `'local'` kind.** `'inmemory'` *means* wipe-on-dispose
  (`InMemorySandbox.dispose` does `fs.rm(root)`); in-place is the semantic opposite (NEVER delete the user's
  tree). Reusing `'inmemory'` (what game-omni does) is a deliberate lie. Add `'local'` to
  `SandboxProviderKind` (the one designed extension point), model in-place as the **trivial `RunScope`**
  (root = repoRoot; per-node `create`; no-op run-level `dispose`), make `downloadDir` **guarded-identity**
  (throw on a real mismatch, not a silent no-op), and **extract the shared `exec` helper** (the 4 providers
  duplicate it).
- **D3 — the registry stays the single tool authority.** game-omni reads `node.tools` directly in its
  command builder and uses a synthetic `nativeToolRegistry` to NO-OP the bind check — both because the
  registry can't resolve the BARE pi names (`read`/`write`) the workflow authors (it addresses builtins as
  `fs:read`). **Fix:** the builtin registry resolves bare pi names (alias) AND `resolve()` returns
  `excludeTools` (from `node.tools.deny`) in `ResolveResult`. Then `defaultPiCommand` derives both
  `--tools` and `--exclude-tools` from `resolved` — no node.tools read, no hack. The dry-run
  `auditWorkflow` keeps the gate-3 whitespace/collision protection.
- **D4 — the two-base distinction is load-bearing → a spine field, not a closure footgun.** Hook POST
  executors need BOTH the repo root (resolves repo-relative marker paths) and the project base
  (`out/<run>`, where ops write). game-omni threads this out-of-band with a `ctx + resolveProjectBase`
  closure whose `?? workspace ?? runCwd` fallback is the silent-misresolve trap. **Fix:** add
  `HookContext.projectBase` (required, explicit); `runHooks` sets it. The DRIVER→Hook codec becomes
  `makeHookCodec(families)` + batteries-included `DRIVER_FAMILIES`; `extractWorkflow`/`extractSpec` promote
  into core; op executors promote with an injected `assetConventions` (the `sprite/tileset/public-assets`
  vocabulary is game-domain — it does NOT go into core); seed-staging consolidates into ONE core executor.
- **D5 — `runFromConfig` is env-agnostic; the CLI owns the convention.** Core ships
  `runFromConfig(resolvedConfig)` (a plain object — no env parsing) so a library consumer passes an object;
  `loadConfig` + the `PI_RUNNER_*` names live in core's CLI layer behind a `piflow run [--dry-run]`
  subcommand. `returnProtocol` generalizes (any pi node needs the write-then-fence handshake) → a default
  `RunOptions.returnProtocol`. **The bridge stays consumer-injected** (it is workflow-dialect-specific):
  `runFromConfig` takes a `workflowSpec`/`buildWorkflowSpec`, it does NOT own the bridge.
- **D6 — node→node values flow through a per-thread RunState, not file-pointers.** Re-pointing at a
  producer's physical file each time (`templates/genres/{out/<run>/spec/classification.json:archetype}.json`)
  couples value · producer-filename/shape · physical location; it resolves only in-place (`resolveSeedTokens`
  → `path.resolve(RUN_CWD, …)`, game-omni `run.mjs:398`) and survives worktree relocation only via a
  `BASE_ROOT→wtRoot` string regex (`run.mjs:331`) that does not cover remote providers. **Fix:** the thread
  carries a LangGraph-style state-channel object (`${RUN}/.pi/state.json`); a POST-hook `promote` op lifts a
  node's output into a channel; consumers reference `${state.<channel>}` plus two engine-resolved logical
  roots — `${WORKSPACE}` (canonical, read-only, OUT-OF-THREAD: skills + registry + components) and `${RUN}`
  (per-thread, mutable, collected). State drives VALUES only (paths/scope/interpolation), resolved at launch
  → static-DAG- and extraction-safe; it never drives ROUTING. **Reshapes U6 + U7.** Full model: the
  *Per-thread RunState* section below.
- **D7 — one engine-owned run layout + a per-node I/O ledger, identical across projects.** The filesystem must
  NOT be project-defined (one repo's `out/` ≠ another's). The SDK OWNS the run layout: `${RUN}` (location
  configurable, STRUCTURE fixed) holds the product tree at its semantic paths PLUS a hidden engine namespace
  `${RUN}/.pi/` with `state.json`, the run digest, and a DEDICATED per-node folder `${RUN}/.pi/nodes/<id>/`
  carrying the realized `prompt.md`/`tools`/`events` (U1's staging, homed here) AND an `io.json` — the
  ALWAYS-RETRIEVABLE record of that node's RESOLVED reads, VERIFIED writes, and `promote`s. So for ANY node in
  ANY project you open `nodes/<id>/io.json` and see its inputs+outputs WITHOUT knowing the node. Full model: the
  *Uniform run layout* section below.
- **D8 — the SOURCE OF TRUTH is the structured init-template, NOT the Claude `.js` [decided 2026-06-23].** The
  Claude Code Workflow `.js` is AUTO-GENERATED by Claude Code and unmaintained by us — at most an UPSTREAM SEED.
  The authored, maintained truth is the structured workflow template (the D7 per-node layout, as DATA:
  prompt+skill-ref · tools · mcp · contract-as-data · hooks · refs). The **init-template skill** builds it by
  TRIAGE: (a) INGEST — a one-time `extractWorkflow` lift of an existing `.js`'s DAG+prompts; or (b) RECONSTRUCT —
  author from other sources (a spec / descriptions / an existing project), no `.js` at all. ONE-TIME ingest
  only: no two-way bridge, no generated `.js` view, NO Claude-Workflow execution target (pi + human + the verify
  harness are the proving ground). **Inverts the original Pi Flow first law** (the `.js`-as-truth premise Pi
  Flow originally carried) — the law now lives, inverted, in `piflow-init`. Full model: the *Source of truth &
  the init-template* section below.
- **D9 — one project filesystem: `.piflow/` with workflow namespaces [proposed 2026-06-23].** All pi-flow state
  lives under `<project>/.piflow/`: an AUTO-DISCOVERED workflow INDEX + one directory per workflow (the
  NAMESPACE), each holding `template/` (the D8 source of truth, COMMITTED) and `runs/<id>/` (the threads,
  GITIGNORED). A run's canonical home is ALWAYS `.piflow/<wf>/runs/<id>/` (= the D7 `${RUN}`) — REGARDLESS of
  execution venue: local, worktree, and remote runs all COLLECT results back here, so the tracked record is
  uniform across projects and venues. Full layout: the *Project filesystem* section below.

## Build order (each: additive · test-first · its own commit · mirrors the named test file)

| # | Unit | Files | Test mirror | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **U1** | Runner per-node staging `_pi/<id>/{prompt,tools,mcp}` (D1) | `runner.ts` | `test/runner.test.ts` (recording-provider writeFile capture) | S–M |
| **U2** | `LocalSandboxProvider` + `'local'` kind + RunScope + exec-helper extract (D2) | `src/sandbox/local.ts`, `types.ts:44`, `index.ts`, `src/sandbox/index.ts` | `test/sandbox.test.ts`, `test/sandbox-worktree.test.ts` | S–M |
| **U3** | Registry: resolve bare builtins + `excludeTools` in `ResolveResult` (D3) | `src/tools/registry.ts`, `types.ts` (ResolveResult), `src/tools/verify.ts` | `test/tools.test.ts` | M |
| **U4** | `defaultPiCommand(node, resolved, ctx, opts?)` — `thinking`, `extraExtensions`, `--exclude-tools` (D3) | `src/runner/command.ts`, `types.ts` | `test/runner.test.ts` (defaultPiCommand block) | S |
| **U5** | `extractWorkflow` → core (D4-A) | `src/workflow/extract.ts`, `index.ts` | new, vs a fixture workflow | S |
| **U6** | RunState spine: `HookContext.{workspace,projectBase}` logical roots + RunState load/merge/persist + `makeHookCodec`/`DRIVER_FAMILIES` (+`promote`) + `extractSpec` (D4-B, **D6**) | `types.ts`, `src/hooks/index.ts`, `src/workflow/{codec,bridge}.ts` | `test/contract.test.ts`, `test/dag.test.ts`, `test/hooks.test.ts` | M |
| **U7** | Op executors + the `${state.*}`/`${WORKSPACE}`/`${RUN}` resolver + `promote` POST-op + `assetConventions` (retires the `BASE_ROOT→wtRoot` regex + RUN_CWD-relative `{file:field}`) (D4-C, **D6**) | `src/workflow/ops/*` | port game-omni `hooks/test/*` | L |
| **U8** | `runFromConfig` + `loadConfig` + `piflow run [--dry-run]` + `RunOptions.returnProtocol` (D5) | `src/runner/{entry,config}.ts`, `src/cli.ts`, `runner.ts` | `test/runner.test.ts` | M |

Sequence: U1 first (unblocks the clean U2/U4 by killing the hacks); U2/U3/U5 are independent; U4 depends on
U3; U6 depends on U5; U7 depends on U6; U8 composes the rest. U7 is the only L — split further if needed.
**D6 reshapes U6 (the RunState spine + the two logical roots) and U7 (the `${state}`/root resolver + the
`promote` op); U4 is orthogonal to state and unaffected.**

## Per-thread RunState (D6) — the run-level state + addressing model

> Added 2026-06-23 from the design discussion. The earlier "token on the read-scope marker" question is
> SUBSUMED here: archetype-narrowed read-scope is just one CONSUMER of `${state.archetype}`. The per-thread
> filesystem mechanics (worktree canonical-file access + remote workspace staging) are being confirmed by a
> read-only investigation; the subsection below states the model and flags the open items.

**Problem.** Pointing a consumer node at a producer's physical file each run couples three things that must be
independent: the *value* (e.g. `archetype`), the *producer's filename/JSON shape*, and the *physical
location*. The current `{file:field}` token resolves against `RUN_CWD` (in-place only) and only survives a
worktree via a `BASE_ROOT→wtRoot` regex — it breaks on a relocating/remote sandbox. This is the local
workaround the SDK exists to remove.

**Model — LangGraph-style state channels over a per-thread filesystem.** The run (thread) carries a state
object of reusable, tracked channels; nodes read/write channels, not each other's files. Two engine-resolved
logical roots are the ONLY path vocabulary:

- **`${WORKSPACE}`** — the CANONICAL, read-only, OUT-OF-THREAD tree: skills (`packages/skills/`), skill
  systems, the registry + code components (`templates/`, `genres.json`, `templates/modules/<archetype>`),
  shared source. NOT per-thread artifacts — the same canonical inputs for every thread. The engine resolves it
  to the canonical copy for the active provider.
- **`${RUN}`** (= U6 `projectBase`) — the PER-THREAD mutable output namespace (`out/<run>`): every artifact
  the run produces, plus the RunState file. Collected back via the portable `downloadDir` contract
  (`types.ts:49` — "the one mechanism every backend supports").

Every workflow path becomes `${WORKSPACE}/…` or `${RUN}/…`; absolute / `RUN_CWD`-relative literals and the
`BASE_ROOT→wtRoot` regex are retired — re-rooting is just "resolve the two roots per provider."
**Uniformity (elegant + simple — the bar):** ONE vocabulary (`${WORKSPACE}` · `${RUN}` · `${state.*}`) and ONE
resolver applied to EVERY marker (artifacts · owns · readScope · seed · schema · merge · prompt) — no
per-marker, no per-provider special-casing. The resolver is the SINGLE place a logical path/value is made
physical; a provider only supplies what `${WORKSPACE}`/`${RUN}` resolve to. If a path isn't expressible in this
vocabulary, that's a design smell, not a special case.

**RunState.** `${RUN}/.pi/state.json` — the per-thread channel object. The engine STAGES it into each node's
sandbox and COLLECTS the updated copy back after the node, so it rides the existing
`create→stage→exec→collect→dispose` lifecycle (`types.ts:241`) and is portable across local/worktree/remote
with no extra machinery. Per-channel reducer: `set` (default) · `append` · `deepMerge` (covers "reuse AND
edit").

**Produce — a POST-hook `promote` op** (LangGraph-grounded: a node EMITS a partial update and the DRIVER applies
the channel's reducer — the node NEVER writes `state.json` itself, exactly the "mechanical → driver hook" law).
The new sibling of `DRIVER-PROJECT`/`DRIVER-MERGE` (same POST family):
`promote: [{ from: '<artifact>:<dotted.field>' | '@return:<field>', to: '<channel>', merge?: 'set'|'append'|'deepMerge' }]`.
After the node exits the engine lifts the value (a produced-file field OR the node's structured return) and
MERGES it into the channel via the reducer. W0: `promote: [{ from: 'spec/classification.json:archetype', to: 'archetype' }]`.

**Reducers & the barrier-merge (the robustness core, = LangGraph super-step semantics).** Each channel has a
reducer: `set` (overwrite — DEFAULT, = LangGraph's no-reducer last-write) · `append` (list concat, =
`operator.add`) · `deepMerge`. In a PARALLEL stage each node emits its update INDEPENDENTLY (to its own return /
owned dir); the driver merges them into `${RUN}/.pi/state.json` at the STAGE BARRIER — serially,
deterministically — so there is NEVER a concurrent write to the shared state file. A channel written by >1
parallel node MUST declare `append`/`deepMerge`; a `set` channel with two concurrent writers is a conflict the
driver flags (LangGraph raises `InvalidUpdateError`). `state.json` is the per-run (= per-thread) CHECKPOINT —
staged in / collected out per node — so resume reads it back for free.

**Consume — a `${state.<channel>}` token** resolved by the driver at NODE LAUNCH from `${RUN}/.pi/state.json` (the
channel exists by then — upstream promoted it and the engine staged it in). Usable in seed `from`, schema,
merge, read-scope, and prompt interpolation — replacing the `RUN_CWD`-relative `{file:field}` for all
CROSS-NODE values. (Intra-node same-file drilling may keep `{file:field}`.)

**Invariants (load-bearing).** `${state.*}`, `${WORKSPACE}`, `${RUN}` are DEFERRED tokens — baked as static
text at extract time, resolved at launch — so `extract.mjs`'s stubbed run never needs a runtime value (same
property as today's token). State drives **values only**; it does NOT drive **routing** (which/how many
nodes) — state-conditioned fan-out is the dynamic-workflow caveat the recording can't see, so the DAG stays
static and channels flow values through it.

**Per-thread filesystem resolution (CONFIRMED by the 2026-06-23 read-only investigation).** The two-root split
already exists de-facto, just unnamed — `RunScope.root`/`RUN_CWD`/`wtPath` is the mutable per-thread root
(`${RUN}`), `outDir` is the host collection namespace, and canonical inputs are a third thing reached
*implicitly by cwd + relative path*, never given a name. Findings:
- **Canonical trees today.** `packages/skills/`, `templates/`, `genres.json`, `templates/modules/*` are
  git-tracked, so under `--worktree` (`git worktree add … HEAD`, `run.mjs:1051`/`worktree.ts:281`) a thread gets
  its OWN PINNED COPY at HEAD; in the in-place `local` default (game-omni's actual posture — no `--worktree`)
  the thread reads the ONE live main checkout by relative path. Only `node_modules` is symlink-shared
  (`run.mjs:1059-74`/`worktree.ts:287-309`).
- **Re-rooting is fragile.** The consumer re-roots a worktree thread with a single `BASE_ROOT→wtRoot` text
  replace on the prompt (`run.mjs:1483`) that fires ONLY for `BASE_ROOT`-absolute strings — so a relative
  `projectDir` (`PROJECT='out/game'`, `game-omni-v1.6.js:97`) and the bare repo-relative skill/template paths
  survive only because cwd happens to be the repo (the documented `projectDir` GOTCHA, `worktree-isolation.md:56-64`,
  still OPEN). The SDK `WorktreeSandboxProvider` does the rewrite NOWHERE — `OpenRunOpts.repoRoot` documents it
  (`types.ts:263-271`) but no code performs it; the SDK relies on cwd + per-node staging of `io.reads`
  (`runner.ts:441-44`). [Unverified whether that absence is a gap or by-design.]
- **The remote gap is load-bearing.** Daytona boots an EMPTY VM (`daytona.ts:507-525`); the runner uploads ONLY
  each node's declared `io.reads`, sourced from `outDir` (`runner.ts:441-44`) — the canonical trees are NOT in
  `io.reads`, so a remote node reaches NEITHER its toolchain deps NOR `templates/`/`packages/skills/`.
  `downloadDir`-out works; canonical upload-IN is ABSENT. (`'e2b'` is a declared kind with no impl.)

**→ Two decisions this forces (for review):**
1. **`${WORKSPACE}` semantics — LIVE vs PINNED — resolve per provider.** `local`/in-place = the LIVE shared tree
   (sees uncommitted canonical edits — what dev + the Hermes self-evolving loop want); `worktree`/remote = a
   PINNED HEAD snapshot (reproducible, parallel-fleet-safe). Same logical root, provider-resolved. A
   `${WORKSPACE}`-rooted reference is then relocation-invariant by construction — no `BASE_ROOT→wtRoot`
   text-replace, no relative-`projectDir` GOTCHA.
2. **`${WORKSPACE}` is the missing remote-staging contract.** Declaring it canonical + read-only is exactly
   what tells a cloud provider to STAGE/upload (or mount/clone) the canonical tree into the VM, distinct from
   `${RUN}` (collected back). Keep `node_modules` symlink/realpath-shared, distinct from canon copy/mount.

### Revised U6 — RunState spine + the two logical roots (was: just `projectBase`)
`HookContext` carries `workspace` (`${WORKSPACE}`) and `projectBase` (`${RUN}`) as the explicit logical roots;
add RunState load/merge/persist helpers over `${RUN}/.pi/state.json`; `makeHookCodec` gains the `promote` family;
the resolver understands `${state.*}`/`${WORKSPACE}`/`${RUN}`. Additive: with no `promote`/`${state}` in a
workflow, `runHooks` + the existing tests stay green (empty state).

### Revised U7 — op executors + the resolver + `promote` (retire the regex)
Promote the op executors AND: (a) the `${state.*}`/`${WORKSPACE}`/`${RUN}` token resolver (generalizes
`resolveSeedTokens` OFF `RUN_CWD` onto the logical roots, replacing the `BASE_ROOT→wtRoot` regex); (b) the
`promote` POST-op; (c) seed/project/merge/schema/read-scope all consume the resolver. `assetConventions`
injection unchanged. **Read-scope narrowing is now just a consumer:**
`readScope: [${RUN}, ${WORKSPACE}/packages/skills/write-gdd, ${WORKSPACE}/templates/modules/${state.archetype}]`.
The within-archetype `src/`-deny remains a separate Seatbelt glob/deny enhancement.

## Uniform run layout + per-node I/O ledger (D7)

> The runtime, physical, per-RUN instance of the design-time node-I/O map the skill already advocates — made
> uniform + engine-owned so it never drifts project to project. Composes with D6 (`state.json` lives here).

**Problem.** Today a project picks its own out-dir (`PROJECT='out/game'`, `game-omni-v1.6.js:97`) and scatters
outputs at project-chosen paths; per-node EXECUTION inputs land in `_pi/<id>/` (U1) but a node's DATA inputs +
outputs are not uniformly recorded anywhere — you must know the workflow to know what a node read/wrote. Across
projects nothing is the same, so tooling can't generically "find a node's I/O."

**The layout (SDK-owned; a project sets only WHERE `${RUN}` roots, NEVER its internal shape):**
```
${RUN}/                         # per-thread workspace (= projectBase); the engine owns the convention
  <product tree>                # spec/ src/ public/ dist/ … — the real artifacts at their semantic paths
  .pi/                          # ENGINE-OWNED metadata namespace — IDENTICAL in every project
    state.json                  # the RunState channels (D6 per-thread checkpoint)
    run.json                    # the run-status digest (per-node status / timing / tokens)
    nodes/<id>/                 # each node's DEDICATED named path
      io.json                   # ALWAYS-RETRIEVABLE: { reads[], writes[], promotes[], status, timing }
      prompt.md  tools.ts  mcp.json   # realized execution inputs (U1's per-node staging, homed here)
      events.jsonl              # behavior stream (debug)
```

**`io.json` — the per-node ledger (the deliverable).** After every node the engine writes a uniform record:
`{ id, label, phase, reads:[{path,via}], writes:[{path,verified,bytes}], promotes:[{to,merge,value}], status, startedAt, endedAt, durationMs }`.
`reads`/`writes` are the contract's `readScope`/`io.reads` and `artifacts`/`owns` RESOLVED through the uniform
resolver and (for writes) VERIFIED on disk — so `io.json` is the verified, physical instantiation of the node's
contract. Written for EVERY node in EVERY project, so "find a node's inputs and outputs" is a GENERIC operation
needing ZERO knowledge of the node's internals — the runtime sibling of `.agents/skill-system-io-map.md` (which
stays the design-time, cross-run ledger).

**Why product files stay at semantic paths (not buried per-node):** a build/tool (the gallery, `npm run build`)
needs `${RUN}/spec/…`, `${RUN}/src/…`, `${RUN}/dist/…` at real paths. So bytes live at their semantic path and
`io.json` RECORDS the resolved path (a pointer) — discoverability without relocating the product. `owns` is the
write-authority; `io.json.writes` is the verified result.

**Composition + unit impact.** D7 is the physical container D6 sits in. It formalizes + extends U1 (per-node
`_pi/<id>/` → `${RUN}/.pi/nodes/<id>/` + `io.json`). The run-layout constants + the `io.json` writer are a
runner/spine concern → fold into the U6 foundation; the `${state}`-resolution + ledger writing land with U7.
**U6 likely SPLITS** — U6a (foundation: the `.pi/` layout + `${WORKSPACE}`/`${RUN}` roots + RunState
type/reducers/load-persist) and U6b (codec + `extractSpec`) — finalize at dispatch.

## Source of truth & the init-template (D8)

> [decided 2026-06-23] Settles the founding question: with hooks, tool limits, MCP, contracts, layout and
> RunState, the system OUTGREW the Claude `.js`. The `.js` was always a PARTIAL slice (skills / registry /
> scaffold / hook-executors were never in it). The structured template is the truth; the `.js` is one-time ingest.

**The authored truth = the structured workflow template** — the D7 per-node layout as DATA, not JS
string-building. Each node is a definition: `{ id, phase, deps, prompt: <template + skill ref>, tools, mcp,
contract: {artifacts, owns, readScope, schema}, hooks: {seed, project, merge, promote} }`, plus a DAG manifest +
refs to skills/registry/scaffold. The engine RENDERS the realized prompt (the `DRIVER-*` markers + DoD prose)
from these fields — `contract()` stops being a JS call. Same shape as the runtime `${RUN}/.pi/nodes/<id>/` (D7),
so authoring ≅ runtime.

**The init-template skill — TRIAGE at construction time:**
- **(a) INGEST from a `.js`** — `extractWorkflow` lifts the DAG + realized prompts ONCE; then the human + skill
  author the "more" extraction can't recover (hooks, tool limits, mcp, contracts-as-data, refs). The `.js` is
  retired after.
- **(b) RECONSTRUCT from other sources** — author the template directly from a spec / descriptions / an existing
  project, with NO `.js`.
Either way the output is the structured template (the truth), maintained directly thereafter.

**Two inits (do not conflate):** init-TEMPLATE (this skill, authoring — build the template) vs init-RUN
(`init(${RUN})`, runtime — instantiate a thread: materialize `.pi/`, copy the product seed, bind `${WORKSPACE}`).

**Single-source discipline (the law that survives):** exactly ONE authored artifact — the template. The `.js` is
never co-authoritative; it is a discardable seed.

**Build reframing (no work wasted):**
- `WorkflowSpec` stays the RUNTIME contract (`compile`→`runWorkflow`). The template is its authored on-disk form
  + a loader (template dir → `WorkflowSpec`). NEW deliverables: the template FORMAT spec + the loader + the
  init-template skill.
- `extractWorkflow`/`extractSpec` (U5 / U6b) are DEMOTED from per-run runtime to the **one-time INGEST adapter**
  inside the init skill.
- Runtime units UNCHANGED — they consume `WorkflowSpec` regardless of origin: U6a (the `.pi/` layout +
  `${WORKSPACE}`/`${RUN}` roots + RunState type/reducers/load-persist + the `io.json` writer), U7 (`${state}`
  resolver + `promote` executor + barrier-merge + contract-as-data rendering), U8 (`runFromConfig` + `init(${RUN})`).
- **No Claude-Workflow execution** ⇒ drop any "generated `.js` view" idea; extraction is ingest-only.

**Venue-independent tracking.** `.piflow/<wf>/runs/<id>/` is the run's CANONICAL HOME and single tracked record.
The execution VENUE varies — local = execute in place there; worktree = execute in a git worktree and collect
back; remote (daytona/e2b) = execute on a VM and `downloadDir` back — but the results (product + `.pi/` ledger +
`state.json`) ALWAYS land here. Even a purely-local run gets its own `runs/<id>/` (no more shared `out/game`),
so local and sandbox runs are recorded identically.

**Committed vs ephemeral.** `template/` + `workflows.json` are COMMITTED (the source of truth); `runs/` is
GITIGNORED (rebuildable from the template). One ignore rule: `.piflow/*/runs/`.

**Layering onto D6/D7/D8.** `${WORKSPACE}` = the project's canonical trees (`packages/skills/`, `templates/`) +
the workflow's `template/` (all read-only at run time). `${RUN}` = `.piflow/<wf>/runs/<id>/`. D7's `.pi/` nests
inside each run; D8's template gets a fixed address (`.piflow/<wf>/template/`).

**Generic-core note.** Core does NOT hardcode `.piflow/<wf>/runs/`; it owns the `.pi/` structure inside a given
run dir and takes `workspace`/`projectBase` as inputs (U6a). The `.piflow/` convention is the CLI/init-run
default (U8) + the init-template skill — so the SDK stays generic, the convention stays uniform.

**Open naming nit:** `.piflow/` (project home) vs `${RUN}/.pi/` (per-run metadata) are close — keep, or rename
the per-run dir (`_meta`/`.run`) to avoid confusion. Minor; flag for decision.

## Out of scope (Phase 2)
The consumer opt-in: game-omni's `pi-runner/sdk/*` switching to import from `@piflow/core` and deleting its
local copies; the `templates/pi-runner/` shrink to ~Tier 1 + a one-line `run.mjs`; the `parse-claude-workflow`
CLI collapsing onto `extractSpec`. Done only AFTER upstream ships U1–U8 and a parity run is green.
