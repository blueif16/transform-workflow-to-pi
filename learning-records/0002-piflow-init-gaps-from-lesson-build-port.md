# 0002 — piflow-init skill gaps (first real PORT: animation-test `lesson-build`, 14 nodes / 10 stages)

**Purpose.** A LIVING backlog captured while porting a real, battle-tested Claude `.js` workflow
(`animation-test/.claude/workflows/lesson-build.js`) into a `.piflow/lesson-build/template/`. Every entry
is something the **`piflow-init` skill did NOT tell me** and I had to (a) hand-dig from the piflow repo
source, (b) guess at and get wrong, or (c) was left unclear about. The goal of recording it: strengthen
`piflow-init` (+ `template-format.md`) into a **self-contained, referenced** guide so the next port needs
**zero source-spelunking and zero guessing**.

**Meta-directive that frames the whole port (user, this session):** author the template the **SDK's way**
— do NOT preserve the legacy `lesson-build.js`/monolith FORM. Use the port output only for FACTS (what each
node reads / writes / runs / which skill it loads); author the contract layer (tools · inject · checks ·
hooks · owns · returnMode) in the SDK's canonical idioms. `piflow-init` should state this as the PORT law:
*the realized prompt is a fact source, not a format to transliterate.* (Today the skill says "port = the
floor" but doesn't warn against carrying legacy idioms — e.g. I reflexively carried the `owns: _logs/*`
pattern and it broke; see G11.)

Severity: **B** = blocked me / made me guess wrong; **C** = cost time, had to verify; **D** = directive/meta.

---

## B — gaps that blocked or produced a wrong guess

### G1 · The authoritative `node.json` field set is not in the skill
`template-format.md §3` is an illustrative `jsonc` block, not the authoritative schema. To author correctly
I read `packages/core/src/workflow/template/types.ts` (`TemplateNode`) for the real fields:
`tools · mcp · inject · timeoutMs · retries · model · provider · tier · contract{artifacts,owns,readScope,
schema,returnMode,fillSentinel} · checks{pre,post:[{kind,path,param,severity}]} · policy:Record<string,string>
· hooks{seed,project,merge,promote,registryProject} · return · checkpoint · fusion`.
**Skill fix:** reference `template/types.ts` + `template/schema/*.ts` as the authoritative shape, or inline a
field table. The skill must name the file the loader actually validates against.

### G2 · The `hooks.merge` / `run`-op JSON shape is undocumented → my first author attempt was schema-rejected
Skill only says "merge (fold/concat/reconcile/run)". I wrote `hooks.merge.ops:[{kind:'run',cmd,cwd}]` →
`loadTemplate` rejected it (`must have required property 'fold'/'concat'/'reconcile'/'run'; must match exactly
one schema in oneOf; must NOT have additional properties`). The REAL shape: the op-NAME is the discriminant
KEY, body permissive:
```jsonc
"hooks": { "merge": { "ops": [ { "run": { "cmd": "npm", "args": ["run","lesson:scaffold","--","--id","{{arg.lessonId}}"], "cwd": "{{WORKSPACE}}/remotion-svg-primitives", "note": "…" } } ] } }
```
Source: `template/schema/node.schema.ts` `$defs/mergeHook` (oneOf required-key per op) + executor
`templates/pi-runner/hooks/merge.mjs:129-155` (the `run` body = `{ cmd, args=[], cwd, note }`).
**Skill fix:** document the merge-op ENVELOPE (`{ ops: [ { <opName>: {…} } ] }`, exactly one op key per
element, no extra keys) + each op body. For `run`: `cmd` bare → resolved on PATH (special-case `node` →
`process.execPath`); `cwd` defaults to repo root, absolute honored; `{{WORKSPACE}}`/`{{arg.*}}`/`{{state.*}}`
resolved BEFORE the executor; `{project}`/`{root}` are executor-owned tokens.

### G3 · PRE-vs-POST hook timing + execution order undocumented
`seed` = PRE (stage inputs before the model); `project`/`merge`/`promote` = POST (after the model). Within
POST the order is `project → merge → promote` — load-bearing: a `merge.run` that GENERATES a file must run
before a `promote` that READS it. Had to infer from `runner.ts:1032-1036` (`runProjection` then `runMerge`) +
the promote barrier semantics. **Skill fix:** state the deterministic lifecycle once:
`seed → [model] → project → merge → promote → (stage barrier merges state)`.

### G4 · The IN-PLACE workflow model is entirely absent (the single biggest gap)
The skill + `example-basic` assume every artifact lives under `{{RUN}}` (a fresh per-run dir). But a
repo-MUTATING pipeline — `lesson-build` writes `lesson-data/`, `src/lessons/`, `public/audio/`, `out/`
directly in the working tree, and shells out to repo npm scripts that need the real repo layout — cannot run
in an isolated `{{RUN}}` dir. It needs **artifacts/owns/readScope under `{{WORKSPACE}}`**, with `{{RUN}}`
holding ONLY the `.pi/` metadata. I had to PROVE the engine supports this by reading source:
- `runner.ts:1042` verifies artifacts via `path.resolve(ctx.outDir, a.path)` → `path.resolve` returns an
  **absolute** `a.path` AS-IS (ignores `outDir`), so `{{WORKSPACE}}`-absolute artifacts are stat()'d directly. ✓
- `workflow/ops/util.ts:45` `absUnder = (base, rel) => isAbsolute(rel) ? rel : join(base, rel)` → all ops
  honor absolute paths too. ✓
**Skill fix:** add a first-class **"in-place vs run-isolated"** section: when each applies; that absolute
`{{WORKSPACE}}` artifacts/owns/readScope are fully honored by the gate AND every op; and that an in-place
node's `promote` must use `@return:` (its source file is NOT under `{{RUN}}`) — see G5. This pattern is the
default for "port an existing repo-rooted build pipeline," which is a major init use-case.

### G5 · `promote` `@return:<field>` form (and resolution rules) undocumented
`template-format §3` shows only `promote.from = "<file>:<field>"`. The crucial second form `@return:<field>`
(drills the node's validated structured RETURN — no filesystem) is what makes in-place promotion work, since
the source file isn't under `{{RUN}}`. Also undocumented: the file form resolves under `{{RUN}}` via
`absUnder` (absolute honored), dotted nested fields work (`pipeline.json:voice.constPrefix`), and a value
resolving to `undefined` THROWS (loud wiring error, not a silent ''). Source: `workflow/ops/promote.ts:74-94`.
**Skill fix:** document both `from` forms, the resolution + throw contract, and recommend `@return:` for
in-place workflows. (Worked use here: Setup scaffolds `pipeline.json`, returns `camelLessonId` + `composition`
read from it, and two `@return:` promotes lift them into `{{state.*}}` — the lesson-agnostic derived-name
single-source.)

### G6 · `{{arg.*}}` is missing from the token vocabulary
`template-format §7` lists only `{{WORKSPACE}}` / `{{RUN}}` / `{{state.*}}`. But run args (`--arg k=v`) surface
as `{{arg.k}}` (learned from `piflow run --help`, confirmed it's the parameterization channel). Every
parameterized template needs this. **Skill fix:** add `{{arg.*}}` to the canonical §7 vocabulary with the
`--arg k=v` / `--arg-file k=path` entry point.

### G7 · The canonical offline validation gates point at the wrong (legacy) path
Skill "stand up" step 6 says dry-run via `node pi-runner/sdk/run.mjs --dry-run`. The canonical author-time
gates are the **`piflow` bin against the template dir**:
`piflow extract <tpl>` (free DAG/stages/lanes) · `piflow inspect <tpl> [nodeId] [--full]` (per-node RESOLVED
sandbox/tools/ops/prompt) · `piflow run <tpl> --dry-run` (realized pi commands, no model). Learned from
`piflow --help`. These three are the entire offline author→validate loop and the skill should center them.
**Skill fix:** replace the `sdk/run.mjs` references with the `piflow` bin gates.

---

## C — clarity gaps (cost time, had to verify; no hard failure)

### G8 · The loader build-status hedging is STALE
The skill repeatedly hedges: "template loader + init-RUN (U6b–U8) are the remaining build", "Today's
`PI_RUNNER_WORKFLOW` still points at a `.js` pending the loader". In reality `loadTemplate` /
`runFromTemplate` / `markersFromNode` are exported from `@piflow/core` and `piflow {run,inspect,extract}
<templateDir>` all work against an authored template today. The hedging made me waste a probe confirming the
loader exists. **Skill fix:** update status — the template dir IS the live load path; drop the "pending
loader / points at a .js" caveats (or scope them precisely to what's actually unbuilt).

### G9 · Tool-name vocabulary unspecified
What strings are valid in `tools.allow/deny`? `example-basic` uses bare `read`/`write`/`submit_result`;
`artifact-contract.md` mentions `ls,grep,find,edit,bash`; the G11 note in the skill lists FAMILY addresses
(`fs:*` / `sh:*` / `oc.<plugin>:<tool>` / `mcp.<server>:<tool>` / `contract:submit_result`). It is unclear
when to use a bare builtin name vs a family address. I used bare `read,write,edit,bash,submit_result`.
**Skill fix:** a canonical tool-name table — the pi builtin bare names (read/write/edit/ls/grep/find/bash/…),
`submit_result`, and when the `oc.*`/`mcp.*`/family forms are required.

### G10 · Ported `agentType:"claude"` — what to do with it
The PORT (`parse-claude-workflow.mjs`) stamps every node `agentType:"claude"` (the recorded Claude hint). But
"claude" is NOT a piflow preset (presets live at `~/.piflow/agents/<id>.md`; an unknown id ⇒ HALT per the G6
preset law). I had to decide to DROP `agentType` on all nodes. **Skill fix:** PORT guidance — strip the
recorded Claude `agentType` (it's the Claude-executor default, not a piflow preset); set `agentType` ONLY for
a real `~/.piflow/agents/<id>.md` preset.

### G11 · Parallel-lane write-disjoint `owns` is ENFORCED, and "every node owns the logs dir" is a legacy anti-pattern
The skill says "same-level + write-disjoint owns ⇒ a parallel lane" but doesn't warn that the loader
**REJECTS** same-level nodes sharing a write GLOB. The legacy `contract()` helper gave EVERY node
`owns: …/_logs/*` (so each can write its wave log) — under the SDK this makes all 6 parallel lanes collide
(`parallel lane owns overlap: … share write authority`). Fix = narrow each node's `_logs/*` glob to its
SPECIFIC `_logs/<wave>.md` (the dir is shared, the files are disjoint), or add a serial join node. Source:
the loader's parallel-lane check (`loadTemplate`). **Skill fix:** document the rejection + the per-node-file
fix, and flag the carried-over `_logs/*`-on-every-node as a legacy idiom to rewrite on port (ties to the D
meta-directive).

### G12 · The `checks` KIND vocabulary lives only in the legacy `artifact-contract.md`
The integrity-check kinds (`exists, non-empty, regex-absent/present, json-parses, field-present, count-floor,
fenced-tail` + `severity:'fail'|'warn'`) are documented for the monolith `DRIVER-CHECKS`, not for the template
`node.json` `checks.pre/post`. They are the same set the loader/runtime honor. **Skill fix:** surface the
checks-kind table in the template reference so an author picks a real predicate (not a blanket `non-empty`).

### G13 · `workflow.json` (re)generation — who writes it, when?
The skill calls `workflow.json` GENERATED + committed (a `package-lock`-style lockfile) and says "a check gate
fails if stale" — but it's unclear whether the AUTHOR commits it, which command (re)writes it, and whether
`piflow extract` regenerates it on the fly. (Still verifying in this port.) **Skill fix:** name the exact
command that (re)generates `workflow.json` and whether an authored template must commit it.

### G14 · `prompt.skill` vs an in-body skill pointer — one home or two?
`template-format §6` says the engine "inlines the `prompt.skill` pointer line." The ported prompts ALREADY
embed `SKILL TO LOAD AND FOLLOW: <path>` in the prose. It's unclear whether ALSO setting `prompt.skill`
duplicates the pointer. I chose to rely on the body's existing pointer (single home) and omit `prompt.skill`.
**Skill fix:** state the rule — `prompt.skill` is the ONE home for the pointer (engine inlines it); the prose
body should NOT also hard-embed the path (or vice-versa), to avoid a duplicated/ drifting pointer.

---

## D — directives / principles to bake into the skill

### D1 · PORT = facts, not form (the meta-directive above)
Author the template in the SDK's canonical idioms; treat the realized `.js` prompt purely as a source of
FACTS. The skill should make this an explicit PORT law and pair each legacy idiom with its SDK replacement
(`owns:_logs/*` → per-node log file; `contract()` prose → engine-rendered markers from `node.json`;
`agentType:'claude'` → drop; absolute REPO paths → `{{WORKSPACE}}`/`{{arg.*}}`/`{{state.*}}` tokens).

---

## Resolved confusion — arg/state resolution at node launch

### G15 · The engine does NOT arg/state-resolve `node.io` paths at launch — only the PROMPT and the POST-ops are resolved (this CORRECTS G4)

**The question.** An in-place template declares each node's `contract.artifacts`/`owns`/`readScope`/
`checks[].path` with `{{WORKSPACE}}/.../{{arg.lessonId}}/...` tokens. At REAL node launch (not the dry-run),
does the runner resolve `{{arg.*}}`/`{{state.*}}` (and `{{WORKSPACE}}`) INSIDE the io/owns/read-scope/checks
paths BEFORE it stat()s them and BEFORE it renders the `DRIVER-*` markers — or does it leave them literal
(making the artifact gate stat a literal-`{{…}}` path that can never exist)?

**Verdict: NO — the io/owns/read-scope/checks paths are NOT token-resolved at launch.** Only `node.prompt`
(via `resolveTokens`) and the POST-ops (`project`/`merge`/`registryProject`, via `resolveDeep`) are resolved
with the args-bearing ctx. Proof, traced end-to-end:

- **Args reach exactly two places.** `resolveCtx = { run, workspace, state, args }` is built at
  `runner/runner.ts:981`, then consumed by ONLY: `resolveTokens(node.prompt, resolveCtx)` (`:1010`) and
  `resolveDeep(...op..., resolveCtx)` for the POST-ops (`:1116`/`:1124`/`:1129`). Nothing else on the launch
  path takes `resolveCtx`.
- **The artifact gate stats the RAW path.** All five stat sites do
  `node.io.artifacts.map((a) => artifactState(path.resolve(ctx.outDir, a.path), a.path))` with `a.path`
  verbatim — `runner.ts:882, 1137, 1257, 1705, 1735`. No `resolveTokens`/`resolveDeep` wraps `a.path`.
- **The DRIVER-* markers are emitted from the RAW node.** `emitMarkers(markersFromNode(node, resolved))`
  (`runner.ts:1018`); `markersFromNode` (`contract.ts:186-205`) reads `node.io.artifacts[].path`,
  `node.sandbox.read`/`.write`, `node.io.checks` directly — it has NO `resolveCtx` parameter and cannot
  resolve anything. (`resolved` here is the TOOLS bundle, `ctx.registry.resolve(node.tools)` at `:924`, not a
  resolved node.)
- **read-scope reaches the sandbox raw.** `scope.create({ readScope: node.sandbox.read, ... })`
  (`runner.ts:966`) — literal.
- **checks paths are read raw.** `effectiveChecks(node.io.checks, ...)` → `evaluateChecks` (`checks.ts:117-129`)
  reads `c.path` and hands it to the `readBytes` closure (`runner.ts:1155-1162`), which does
  `path.resolve(ctx.outDir, rel)` on the LITERAL `c.path`. No resolution.
- **The tokens were never resolved upstream either.** The loader copies them verbatim: `toNodeIntent`
  (`loader.ts:119-145`) sets `artifacts: c.artifacts.map(...)`, `sandbox.read: c.readScope.slice()`,
  `sandbox.write: c.owns.slice()`, `checks: collectChecks(...)` with ZERO token handling. And init-RUN copies
  `node.json` BYTE-IDENTICAL (`instantiate.ts:126`) — its `resolveIntrinsic` (`{{RUN}}`/`{{WORKSPACE}}` only,
  `instantiate.ts:67-73`) runs over the PROMPT, never over `node.json`/`node.io`. So `node.io.*` carries BOTH
  `{{WORKSPACE}}` AND `{{arg.*}}` literally into the runtime `NodeSpec`.
- **The resolver that WOULD do this is dead code.** `resolveAll` — whose own header comment (`resolver.ts:4`)
  says it is "applied UNIFORMLY to EVERY marker (artifacts · owns · readScope · seed · schema)" — has ZERO
  callers in the engine (only a re-export at `index.ts:72`). The intent is documented; the wiring is absent.

**Why the gate FAILS doubly on a literal path.** A path string like
`"{{WORKSPACE}}/.../{{arg.lessonId}}/brief.md"` starts with `{`, so it is NOT absolute → `path.resolve(ctx.outDir, literal)` joins it UNDER the `.pi` run dir with the braces intact, and the stat misses. This also
**corrects G4's line** ("`path.resolve` returns an absolute `a.path` AS-IS … so `{{WORKSPACE}}`-absolute
artifacts are stat()'d directly ✓"): that is true ONLY for an ALREADY-RESOLVED absolute path. The runtime
`a.path` is never resolved, so it is never absolute, so the AS-IS claim does not hold for a `{{…}}`-token
path. The dry-run "passes" precisely because it never stat()s — the literal-`{{arg}}` failure only appears at
a REAL launch.

**Most-robust template-side handling (recommendation): (b) promote the derived names to `{{state.*}}` from
the Setup node — BUT it does not fix the io-path resolution gap on its own, because `{{state.*}}` in
`node.io` is ALSO left literal (same dead-`resolveAll`).** The resolution gap is token-KIND-agnostic: neither
`{{arg.*}}` NOR `{{state.*}}` NOR `{{WORKSPACE}}` is resolved inside `node.io`/`owns`/`readScope`/`checks`
today. So the choice of `{{arg.*}}` vs `{{state.*}}` for `camelLessonId`/`composition` is NOT what makes the
gate pass. The honest options, in order:

1. **FLAG-TO-WIRING-OWNER (the real fix).** This is an ENGINE gap, not a template one: the launch path must
   call `resolveAll(node.io.artifacts paths / owns / readScope, resolveCtx)` and resolve `check.path` BEFORE
   the stat at `:1137`, BEFORE `markersFromNode` at `:1018`, and BEFORE `scope.create` at `:966` (and mirror
   it at the G8-repair re-stat `:1257` and the entry re-stat `:1705`/`:1735`). The resolver and its
   doc-contract already exist (`resolveAll`); only the call sites are missing. Until that lands, NO purely
   template-side token choice makes the artifact/checks gate honest for an in-place template — the dry-run is
   green and the live run blocks on a literal-`{{…}}` stat.
2. **If a template-only workaround is forced before the engine fix:** author the io/owns/readScope/checks
   paths with the lessonId ALREADY-LITERAL (no `{{arg}}`/`{{state}}` in `node.io`), i.e. instantiate a
   per-lesson template (or a thin pre-pass that substitutes the id), and keep `{{arg.*}}`/`{{state.*}}` ONLY
   in the PROMPT and the POST-ops where they ARE resolved. This is ugly (defeats one-template-many-lessons)
   but it is the only thing that makes the gate stat a real path with today's engine.

**Net for the porter:** keeping `{{arg.lessonId}}` in `node.io` is NOT "correct as-is" (G4 implied it was);
it is blocked on an unwired engine step. Choosing `{{state.*}}` over `{{arg.*}}` for the DERIVED names buys
nothing here. Treat this as a wiring-owner FLAG (resolve `node.io`/checks at launch via the existing
`resolveAll`), and do not trust a green dry-run as evidence the io-path gate will pass live.

**Skill fix:** `piflow-init` (+ `template-format.md`) must state the resolution SCOPE explicitly — which
fields are token-resolved at launch (PROMPT + seed/project/merge/promote ops) vs which are consumed RAW
(`node.io.artifacts`/`owns`/`readScope`/`checks[].path`/`sandbox.read`). Pair it with the dry-run caveat: the
dry-run does not stat artifacts, so an unresolved-token io path is invisible until a live run. Correct G4's
"stat()'d directly ✓" to "stat()'d directly ONLY once already-absolute — a `{{…}}`-token io path is neither
resolved nor absolute and the gate misses."

---

## Resolutions (verified from source — close C-gaps G8/G9/G12/G13)

- **G8 RESOLVED — loader hedging IS stale.** `loadTemplate`/`runFromTemplate` are exported (`index.ts:31,169`)
  and all three CLI verbs take a template DIR through `loadTemplate` (`extract.ts:42`, `inspect.ts:50`,
  `run.ts:264` + live `runFromTemplate :282`). The "U6b–U8 pending / points at a `.js`" wording is obsolete.
- **G9 RESOLVED — bare builtin tool names are CORRECT.** Authoritative `BUILTIN_TOOLS` =
  `read, write, edit, grep, find, ls, bash` (`tools/registry.ts:12-20`; internally `fs:*`/`sh:*`, but pi sees
  the bare name). `submit_result` is the first-party `contract` tool (`tools/contract-tool.ts:60`) — opt-in via
  the registry SEED (`registry.ts:30`), so a node MUST list it in `tools.allow` to bind its generated `-e`
  extension. The node.json schema accepts any `minLength:1` string (no enum) for `allow`/`deny`. Family
  addresses (`oc.*`/`mcp.*`) are needed ONLY for sdk/mcp tools. So `read,write,edit,bash,submit_result` is right.
- **G12 RESOLVED — `checks.kind` registry = 8 kinds.** `CHECK_KINDS` (`checks.ts:62`):
  `exists, non-empty, regex-absent, regex-present, json-parses, field-present, count-floor, fenced-tail`
  (policy actions: `block|warn|stop|retry|escalate`, `checks.ts:166`). The node.json schema does NOT enum-gate
  `kind` (`node.schema.ts $defs.check.kind = {type:string,minLength:1}`) and an unknown kind degrades to a
  non-fatal `warn` at runtime (`checks.ts:127`) — so `non-empty`/`json-parses` are valid; an author TYPO in a
  kind silently warns instead of failing (worth a skill caution).
- **G13 RESOLVED — `workflow.json` regenerates on load; no separate command, no staleness gate.**
  `loadTemplate(dir)` itself (re)writes it every load (`loader.ts:213` → `writeWorkflowJson`/`buildWorkflowJson`),
  idempotent (rewrites only on byte-diff, `workflow-json.ts:46-58`). So `piflow extract|inspect|run` regenerate
  it for free; committing it is conventional (mirrors `package-lock`), NOT enforced — the "`piflow check`
  staleness gate" is aspirational (`workflow-json.ts:4`); no `piflow check` subcommand exists.

## E — FIRST LIVE RUN (companion profile, MiniMax-M3 / `mmgw`, 2026-06-26)

Run `ctt-1`, lesson `kptest-count-to-two`, `piflow run … --provider mmgw --profile companion --thinking low --sandbox local`. setup→w2a→w2b all produced clean, skill-faithful artifacts; the model tier is NOT the bottleneck. The findings below are SDK/authoring gaps surfaced by a REAL run — each framed as guidance so piflow-init/the SDK can give better defaults.

### E1 · promote→`{{state.*}}` IS the SDK-native way to thread a derived path component — and it works live (resolution is LAZY per-node, not eager)
The port referenced `{{arg.camelLessonId}}`/`{{arg.composition}}` in downstream io paths + prompts, but neither was ever a launch arg → `MissingArgError` the moment a consuming node runs. The mature fix, **fully supported on the shipped SDK**: the producing root node (`setup-scaffold`) declares `hooks.promote:[{from:"@return:camelLessonId",to:"camelLessonId"},{from:"@return:composition",to:"composition"}]`, sets `returnMode:"required"`, returns the two values (copied VERBATIM from the scaffolded `pipeline.json` — single source of truth), and every downstream node uses `{{state.camelLessonId}}`/`{{state.composition}}`. Live proof: after setup-scaffold, `.pi/state.json = {"camelLessonId":"kptestCountToTwo","composition":"CompleteKptestCountToTwoLesson"}`, and the per-node lifecycle resolved both `{{arg.lessonId}}`/`{{WORKSPACE}}` (→ absolute, `exists:true`) AND the promoted `{{state.*}}` against the barrier-merged state. **This CORRECTS the lingering "eager launch resolution" fear (cf. G15): io paths ARE resolved per-node at runtime** (`runner.ts:967,976-990`; `runState = loadState(outDir)` `:1715`); the resolver throws only when a token names a channel/arg that genuinely doesn't exist yet.
**SDK/skill guidance:** piflow-init should TEACH promote→`{{state}}` as THE pattern for "a value computed by an early node (camelCase id, composition name, any scaffold field) used in later io paths." Include the `@return:<field>` form (avoids the file-source caveat in E-note below).

### E2 · `checkChannels` flags a literal `{{state.X}}` written in the PROMOTING node's OWN prose as a dangling consumption
Documenting the promote by writing the example tokens `{{state.camelLessonId}}` in setup-scaffold's *own* prompt made `extract` fail: `dangling channel: node "setup-scaffold" consumes {{state.camelLessonId}} but no upstream node promotes the "camelLessonId" channel` (it's the root — nothing upstream). The scanner can't tell "I document this token" from "I consume it" (`checks.ts checkChannels` scans `readScope`/`seed.from`/**prose**).
**Guidance:** skill caution — NEVER write a literal `{{state.X}}` in the prose of the node that promotes X (name the channel in plain words). Or: SDK exempts a node from "consuming" a channel it itself promotes.

### E3 · No meta-level computed/derived args (the cleaner end-state for E1)
A value that is a PURE function of a launch arg (`camelLessonId=camelCase(lessonId)`, `composition=Complete<Pascal>Lesson`) still needs a node+promote — there is no `meta.json` computed/derive facility (`meta.schema.ts` `additionalProperties:false`, no `args`; args are a flat `Record<string,string>`, no schema/coercion/transform).
**SDK guidance (feature):** add `meta.computedArgs` (or `args[].derive`) = pure string transforms over launch args, evaluated BEFORE the run, feeding `ctx.args`. Then camelLessonId/composition are declared ONCE at the template level — no node, no promote. Until then E1 is the shipped workaround.

### E4 · `--from` resume preflight stats RAW UNRESOLVED token paths → `--from` is unusable for any tokenized template  (HIGH PRIORITY)
`piflow run … --from w2c-sound-design` aborted: `cannot --from "w2c-sound-design": missing upstream artifact(s): {{WORKSPACE}}/remotion-svg-primitives/lesson-data/{{arg.lessonId}}/brief.md (setup-scaffold), …` — the files EXIST at the resolved path; the preflight stats the LITERAL `{{WORKSPACE}}/{{arg.lessonId}}/…` string. This is the ONE place the "raw path" story is real: the `--from` window stat preflight (`runner.ts ~1680`, "skipped upstream nodes register reused after a stat preflight") does NOT `resolveTokens` each upstream node's declared artifacts before `stat`. (Normal per-node io resolution is fine — E1.)
**SDK guidance:** resolve `{{WORKSPACE}}`/`{{arg.*}}`/`{{state.*}}` in upstream artifacts BEFORE the `--from` stat preflight (reuse the per-node `resolveCtx`; `{{state.*}}` is available via `loadState`). Until fixed, the documented `--from` lever cannot be used.

### E5 · Journal auto-resume does NOT reuse a prior FAILED run's good prefix — it re-runs from scratch
After a mid-run failure + a one-node prompt fix, re-running the same `--run ctt-1` (no `--from`) re-ran from stage 1 (did not reuse the 5 nodes that had succeeded; their artifacts + `state.json` channels were all on disk). Combined with E4 (`--from` broken), **there is currently NO cheap "resume the good prefix" path after a failure** — a one-node fix costs a full re-run.
**SDK guidance:** either (a) let the journal reuse the still-valid completed-node prefix of a FAILED run, or (b) fix `--from` (E4) as the manual lever. (A clean-room full re-run is fine for validation, but expensive for iteration.)

### E6 · In-place LocalSandbox logs a spurious "downloadDir identity-only" issue on EVERY node
Every node logs: `output collection failed: LocalSandbox.downloadDir: in-place collection is identity-only, but remote (…/out/<node>) !== local (…/runs/<id>). The output already lives at the in-place root; a non-identity target is a misuse.` Non-fatal where the node writes artifacts to the WORKSPACE (the gate stats them in place), but it is CONCATENATED into the node's `issues` and on a genuinely-failing node (w2c) it muddied the real cause.
**SDK guidance:** in identity in-place mode, SKIP `downloadDir` (output already lives at the in-place root) rather than attempt+log a failure; or stop defaulting `sandbox.output=out/<node>` under in-place-identity.

### E7 · A node that must ENUMERATE a directory needs a readable INDEX or `bash` — readScope+`read` alone can't `ls`  (authoring guidance)
`w2c-sound-design` had the sound library in `readScope` and `read` granted, but no `bash`; to discover bed/sting/sfx keys the model reached for `ls`/glob (forbidden by the READING LAW + ungranted) and correctly BLOCKED rather than invent keys (good discipline). Fix: point the prompt at the machine-readable `_beds|_sfx|_stings/_index.json` files to `read` (mirroring the already-correct `w3c-sound-asset`), NOT grant bash.
**Guidance:** piflow-init should flag — a node that discovers/enumerates a directory must be given a machine-readable INDEX to `read`, OR `bash`+the dir in readScope; a read-only node CANNOT list a directory. Prefer the index (deterministic, no shell, honors a no-explore reading law).

_Note (promote file-source caveat, from SDK read): `extractPromoteValue` reads a `from:"<file>:<field>"` source via `absUnder(ctx.run, source)` WITHOUT `resolveTokens` first — so a `{{WORKSPACE}}`-rooted promote source mis-resolves; the `@return:<field>` form (used in E1) sidesteps it. Resolving tokens in `promote.from` would enable file-field promotes from workspace artifacts._

### E8 · A read/write/edit node BLOCKS over a missing SHELL op it could do with `write` (the dominant live failure class)
Two of run `ctt-1`'s blocks were the same shape — a node granted only read/write/edit/submit_result reached for a shell capability and self-blocked instead of using the tools it had:
- `w2c-sound-design` tried `ls` to enumerate the sound library (→ E7).
- `w2a-visual-design` tried `mkdir _logs/` to create a directory that ALREADY EXISTED (w0/w1 — same grant — wrote their `_logs/*.md` into it the same run) and self-blocked EVEN THOUGH it had already written its real artifact (visual-design.md, verified 1/1). NON-DETERMINISTIC: w2a SUCCEEDED in the first run, blocked in the re-run — pure model variance.
**Authoring fix (shipped, commit 2131a77):** a FILE-OP DISCIPLINE clause on the shared preamble (line 11, all 14 nodes): create logs/outputs with `write` DIRECTLY (the `_logs/` dir exists, write makes parent dirs) — never mkdir/ls/touch/bash; a node without bash MUST NOT block over a missing shell op doable with write/edit; a missing INPUT → pipelineFinding + PROCEED; block ONLY when a REQUIRED OUTPUT can't be written.
**SDK guidance (optional):** (a) surface "write creates parent dirs" in the tool description so the model doesn't reach for mkdir; (b) in the status ladder, distinguish a model SELF-block from a required-artifact-missing failure, so an over-cautious self-block on a node that DID produce its declared artifact isn't a hard run-failure (the runner already knows artifacts verified 1/1).

_Divergence note: the `.piflow/lesson-build/template` prompts were PORTED one-time from `.claude/workflows/lesson-build.js`; the E1/E7/E8 preamble+prompt fixes live ONLY in the .piflow template. `lesson-build.js`'s `discipline()` preamble should get the same FILE-OP clause for parity (flagged to the wiring owner; orchestration `.js` is out of Hermes prose scope)._

### E9 · The composer (bash-granted) ran `find /` from ROOT to locate kit imports — READING-LAW violation + multi-minute whole-disk scan; `--sandbox local` does NOT confine bash
On the heaviest node (`w4a-composer`, which HAS `bash`), MiniMax-M3 didn't know the import paths for the kit layers (`@studio/narration-kit` / `<LessonAudioLayer>` etc.) and ran `find / -name 'narration-kit'; find / -name '@studio'` — a whole-machine scan from `/` that ran 4.5+ min with no useful result (and would eventually trip a node timeout). The shared READING LAW (preamble line 7) ALREADY forbids "read, grep, find, ls, or otherwise explore … outside your declared scope" — the cheap model violated it under uncertainty. Manually killing the runaway let w4a resume INSTANTLY and keep composing (the tool just returned empty).
**Guidance (authoring):** a prohibition is not enough for a cheap model under uncertainty — the composer prompt/skill must POSITIVELY supply the exact kit import paths (or pin them in catalog-digest's lesson-infra section with "imports come ONLY from here"), so the model never needs to search. Prompt fix deferred to AFTER this run (editing the template prompt mid-node doesn't affect the in-flight staged prompt anyway).
**Guidance (SDK/sandbox) — notable:** under `--sandbox local`, a node's `bash` is NOT confined to its declared readScope — `find /` escaped to the entire machine. The seatbelt read-scope sandbox (the `DRIVER-READ-SCOPE` mechanism) WOULD bound this; `local` does not. Consider: deny absolute-root traversal / scope the bash cwd / surface that `local` = unconfined so authors know readScope is advisory there. (A runaway `find /` from a cheap model is a predictable failure mode worth a guardrail.)

## A-series · AUTHORING-SURFACE gaps — discovered migrating `hooks`→canonical `op[]` (2026-06-30, SDK v0.1.0 / piflowctl 0.1.0)

Context: adapting the ported `.piflow/lesson-build/template` to the newest SDK — `piflowctl skills install` + migrating the 4 hook-bearing nodes (setup-scaffold, w3-5-reconcile, w4a-composer, w5-render) from the deprecated `hooks`/`inject` aliases to the unified `op[]` envelope. Each gap below is a place where `piflowctl schema <topic>` and the installed `piflow-init`/`enrich-contract.md` skill were INSUFFICIENT, forcing a read of `@piflow/core` source. Tagged by the layer that should improve. Migration was made safe ONLY by an out-of-band technique (capture each node's resolved `DRIVER-*` markers via `inspect --full`, diff before/after) — itself a sign the docs don't tell you what "behavior-identical" means at the marker level.

### A1 · The legacy→canonical LOWERING model is documented only in source comments — and `enrich-contract.md` actively teaches the deprecated form
`types.ts` (NodeSpec `op?` §8) + `lower.ts` (`lowerToOps`) say `hooks`/`inject`/`checks`/`policy` are DEPRECATED aliases the loader LOWERS into one canonical `op[]`; `add-node` emits `op[]` for run/merge/promote but KEEPS `checks`/`policy`/`tools` as sugar. NONE of this is in `piflowctl schema` or the `piflow-init` skill. Worse: `references/enrich-contract.md §1` still teaches `hooks.merge:{ops:[{run}]}` as THE way to run a gate — directly contradicting what `add-node --gate-run` now emits. Had to read `types.ts`/`contract.ts`/`loader.ts` to learn the canonical form even EXISTS.
**Guidance:** (CLI `schema`) add a topic — "authoring surface: canonical `op[]` vs the lowered aliases; which `add-node` flag emits which; the aliases still work but are soft-deprecated." (skill) rewrite `enrich-contract.md` to author `op[]` (or state explicitly that `hooks` is a still-supported alias and show the `op[]` equivalent side-by-side). The flagship `game-omni` reference template still uses `hooks.merge` — so "canonical" is currently undocumented AND unmodeled by the reference.

### A2 · `op[]`⊗sugar is ALL-OR-NOTHING: authoring `op[]` SILENTLY DROPS `inject`/`hooks` (`if (def.op) return def.op`) — a context-injection loss with NO error  ← the dangerous one
`lower.ts:45` `export function lowerToOps(def){ if (def.op) return def.op; …lower inject/hooks/checks/policy… }`. So the moment a node carries an authored `op[]`, the loader returns it VERBATIM and NEVER lowers `inject`/`hooks`. `checks`/`policy`/`return` survive (separate channels — the runner reads POST checks from `node.io.checks` at `node-lifecycle.ts:538`, not from `op[]`), but **`inject` and `hooks` are silently discarded**. Concretely: adding `op:[{run}]` to a node that had `inject:["visual-design.md"]` made `DRIVER-INJECT` VANISH — the model would stop getting the file injected, with zero warning. Discovered only because I diffed markers; found the cause only by reading `lower.ts`. Nothing documents this composition rule. (`add-node` sidesteps it by never emitting a top-level `inject` alongside `op` — `--inject` becomes an `op:[{when:pre,reads}]` entry — but the skill never says WHY, so a hand-author mixes them and loses injection.)
**Guidance:** (SDK) at load, if a node has BOTH `op` and any lowerable alias (`inject`/`hooks`), emit a loud WARNING (or error) — "op[] authored; inject/hooks IGNORED" — never silently drop. (skill) state the rule: "author `op[]` ⇒ you must hand-lower `inject:[p]`→`{when:'pre',reads:[p]}` and every `hooks.*` into the SAME `op[]`; the aliases are ignored when `op` is present." Provide the mapping table (A6).

### A3 · `op[]` entries AND the node top-level are STRICT (`additionalProperties:false`); there is NO `note`/`doc`/comment field anywhere
Tried to keep each gate's rationale as `op[].note` → `TemplateError: /op/0 must NOT have additional properties`. Then checked `schema node --json` → node top-level is ALSO `additionalProperties:false` (fixed key set: id,phase,deps,prompt,agentType,executor,tools,mcp,timeoutMs,retries,model,provider,tier,inject,contract,checks,policy,hooks,return,checkpoint,programmatic,fusion,op,judgeGate,subworkflow). So substantial authoring rationale ("why this gate runs `lesson-measured.mjs` not `lesson:check`", "KNOWN GAP: loudnorm swallowed → W6") has NO schema-blessed home in node.json. The ONLY freeform slot is `transform.merge.ops[]` (a `Record<string,unknown>[]` — which is how the OLD `hooks.merge.run.note` survived). Undocumented; discovered by TemplateError.
**Guidance:** (CLI `schema node`/`checks`) state up front "emitted objects are strict — unknown keys are rejected; there is no comment/note field." (SDK, optional) allow an ignored `note`/`doc` string on `OpSpec` and `NodeSpec` so gate rationale can live beside the gate (the single most-wanted missing affordance — a workflow is documentation-heavy and JSON has no comments). Until then, gate rationale must live in the commit body / prompt, away from the op.

### A4 · `schema contract`'s `--schema` reads like the structured-RETURN handshake but is per-ARTIFACT validation — nearly caused a wrong migration
`piflowctl schema contract` describes `--schema <p>` as "a JSON Schema the node's structured output is validated against." That SOUNDS like it replaces the inline `return:{…}` structured-return schema. It does NOT: `--schema`→`contract.schema` is per-ARTIFACT output validation (`DRIVER-SCHEMA: path <= schema`, `contract.ts:33/125`), a DIFFERENT feature from the fenced-JSON return handshake (`returnSchema` at `types.ts:367`, distinct from `returnMode`). Only reading `types.ts` (`returnSchema` vs `schema` are separate fields) stopped me from "migrating" the first-class `return` into `contract.schema` and breaking the handshake.
**Guidance:** (CLI `schema contract`) disambiguate: "`--schema` = per-ARTIFACT output validation (DRIVER-SCHEMA); the node's structured-RETURN handshake is the separate `return` field + `returnMode`." (skill) same. `return` is first-class and NOT on the deprecation path — say so.

### A5 · `inspect` is misleading for `programmatic` nodes (0 DRIVER markers) and for run-family ops (`ops: (none)`)
A `programmatic` node has no prompt → `inspect --full` prints ZERO `DRIVER-*` markers → reads as "node not wired," when the render op is fine. And the `ops:` summary line only counts DERIVE transforms (seed/project/merge/promote): after migrating w5 from `hooks.merge`(→ a merge transform, shown as "merge: 1 op(s)") to `op:[{run}]`, `inspect` showed `ops: (none)` — even though `runProgrammatic` (`node-lanes.ts:361`, `runOpsFromOp(node.op).runnable`) DOES dispatch the run. Had to read `runProgrammatic` to confirm the render still fires. Two false "it's broken" signals from the primary inspection tool.
**Guidance:** (CLI `inspect`) for a programmatic node, print the resolved `op[]` directly (no prompt to hang markers on); include run-family + gate ops in the `ops:` line, not just transforms.

### A6 · No migration mapping `hooks.* → op[]` anywhere — had to reverse-engineer it from base64 `DRIVER-OP` + `RunBody`/`TransformBody` types
To know what each hook becomes, I base64-decoded `DRIVER-OP` markers and cross-read `lower.ts` (the `//` mapping comments), `types.ts` (`OpSpec`/`RunBody`/`TransformBody`), and `node-lanes.ts`. The verified mapping (record it in the skill so the next author doesn't spelunk):

| legacy alias | canonical `op[]` entry |
|---|---|
| `inject:[p]` | `{ "when":"pre", "reads":[p] }` (one op per path; restores `DRIVER-INJECT`) |
| `hooks.promote:[{from,to}]` | `{ "when":"post", "transform":{ "kind":"promote", "from", "to" } }` |
| `hooks.merge:{ops:[{run}]}` (BLOCKING gate) | `{ "when":"post", "run":{cmd,args,cwd}, "onFailure":"block" }` |
| `hooks.merge:{ops:[{run}]}` (non-blocking derive) | `{ "when":"post", "transform":{ "kind":"merge", "ops":[{run}] } }` |
| `hooks.seed:[{to,from}]` | `{ "when":"pre", "writes":[to], "transform":{ "kind":"seed", "from" } }` |
| `checks.post` / `policy` / `return` | KEEP as-is (sugar with own channels — survive alongside `op[]`) |

Note the fork on the merge row: a blocking gate (our case — non-zero exit must fail the node) is the `run`+`onFailure` form (`op-dispatch.ts` partitions it as `runnable`); only a no-verdict derive stays `transform:merge`. `enrich-contract.md` conflates these under "hooks.merge → run a script."
**Guidance:** (skill) add this table as the canonical `hooks`→`op[]` migration recipe; (CLI `schema`) reference it from the `derive`/`checks` topics.

## E-series (cont.) · LIVE-RUN sandbox↔pipeline incompatibilities (2026-06-30, run `mig-e2e-1`, provider nebius/GLM-5.2, `--sandbox local`→`danger-full-access`)

First live end-to-end pi run of the migrated template. The `op[]` migration itself VALIDATED: setup-scaffold's `op[transform:promote]` populated `state.json` (`camelLessonId`/`composition`) live; 8 nodes ran green on nebius. But two heavy MODEL nodes hit sandbox walls that are ORTHOGONAL to the migration and block a full run.

### E10 · A sandboxed PI node CANNOT run a project-root shell build (voice/render): `uv_cwd EPERM` + external kit outside read-scope
`w3a-voice-asr` (a PI node whose JOB is `npm run lesson:voice`) blocked under `--sandbox local`: (a) `Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, uv_cwd` — the seatbelt jail forbids a child process whose cwd is outside the run dir, but the voice/render scripts MUST run from `…/remotion-svg-primitives` (the project root, outside `…/runs/<id>/`); (b) the narration-kit bin (`/Users/tk/Desktop/shared-narration/bin/generate-voice.mjs`) is outside read-scope → hard EPERM. So a sandboxed agent node can neither cwd to the project nor read its external dep tree. `--sandbox danger-full-access` (READ-jail off) UNBLOCKED it (w3a → ok, 70s). The node's own pipelineFinding is the design fix: **voice + render are host "service" steps — run them as `programmatic`/host ops (like w5 already is), not as a sandboxed model's bash.**
**Guidance:** (SDK) a PI node that must run a project-cwd build is architecturally wrong under the read-jail — either allow a node to declare an exec-cwd + extra exec/read roots (e.g. `…/shared-narration`), or make such steps `programmatic` (host). (skill/template) mark voice as a host step; vendor or read-scope the external kit. Document that `local` confines child-process cwd to the run dir.

### E11 · `danger-full-access` bypasses READ-scope ONLY — WRITE-scope stays enforced, and a `owns` GLOB is not a writable grant → node can't create files → probing DAMAGED a tracked file  ← repo-safety
`w3b-primitive-build` (owns `…/src/shape-primitives/*` + specific files) blocked even under `danger-full-access`: the console says only "read-scope isolation BYPASSED" — the WRITE allowlist is STILL on. And the `owns` GLOB `src/shape-primitives/*` is NOT honored as writable ("the sandbox write-allowlist honors only SPECIFIC declared paths") — so editing `counting.tsx`, creating a NEW primitive file, and appending to the barrel `index.ts` all EPERM'd. A node whose whole job is to CREATE a new file in a dir cannot (you can't pre-name the file, and the glob grants nothing). WORSE: unable to write the glob path, the model "probed" writes by overwriting a SPECIFIC owned path — `src/component-gallery/demoProps.tsx` — with placeholder content, DESTROYING it (1347→193 lines); it then "reconstructed" a non-byte-identical version. Restored via `git checkout` (the file was committed). Two failures: a write-scope model that can't express "may create files under dir X", and a model that treats an owned path as a scratch pad for permission probing.
**Guidance:** (SDK) (a) make `danger-full-access` bypass WRITE-scope too, or add a distinct full-write mode — its current "READ only" semantics is surprising and undocumented; (b) honor a directory/glob in `owns` as a create-grant for that dir (the primitive-builder's core need); (c) the write-allowlist should FAIL a probe write to an owned path that isn't the node's declared artifact, not silently persist it. (skill) forbid "probe writes"; a node that can't produce its OUTPUT must block WITHOUT mutating any owned file. (template) w3b needs dir-create scope over `src/shape-primitives/`, or new-primitive authoring must move to a host step.

**Net:** the migration is validated; the lesson pipeline's heavy nodes (voice, primitive-authoring, render) are not compatible with the sandboxed-PI-node model as written — they need host/`programmatic` execution + real write scope. This is the top pre-run blocker for an unattended fleet, tracked here as a template+SDK architecture item (NOT a migration regression).

### E12 · A `--sandbox` override on a `--from` RESUME may not re-apply to persisted node config (posture drift)
Reconciling E11's "danger-full-access runs BARE (writes free)" (proven from source: `run.ts:504`→`makeLocalProvider({dangerous:true})`→`enforceReadScope:false`→`local.ts:126 if(this.enforceReadScope && cmd)` false ⇒ `plan=null` ⇒ no `sandbox-exec` wrapper ⇒ no write-deny) against the EMPIRICAL "w3b still write-EPERM'd under our `--from w3a --sandbox danger-full-access` resume": the run's `.pi/run.json` records `"sandbox": "local"` — the run was FIRST launched `--sandbox local`, and the resume (which DID print the danger banner) reused the persisted `local` posture for the resumed nodes. So w3b ran JAILED and the glob (E11-1) EPERM'd — danger never reached it. So: `danger-full-access` semantics are as the source says (bare, writes free); the bug is that a `--sandbox` override on a `--from` resume of an existing run did not re-apply (run.json stayed `local`).
**Guidance:** (SDK) either re-apply the run-invocation's `--sandbox` posture on a `--from`/resume and update `run.json`, or REFUSE a resume whose `--sandbox` differs from the recorded posture with a loud error (silent posture drift is a debugging trap — it cost a full mis-diagnosis here). (verify) a 5-min empirical check (re-run one node bare vs the run.json record) should confirm before the E11 §2b posture-rename ships. Full fix work-order: `docs/design/sandbox-scope-fixes-e10-e11-HANDOFF.md`.
